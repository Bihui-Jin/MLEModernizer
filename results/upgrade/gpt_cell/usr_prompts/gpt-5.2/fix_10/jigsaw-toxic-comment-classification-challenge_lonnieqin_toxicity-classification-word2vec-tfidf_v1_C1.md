# Goal

You will receive environment details and a partial notebook export.

# Requirements

- Fix the bug that causes the error in cell k.
- Do NOT adjust any other non-buggy cells.
- You may reference cell k+1 only to preserve variable/interface compatibility.
- Do not complete or extend code logic in cell k, k+1, or later cells.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (bug fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Output must follow your strict format: Diagnosis / Patch summary / Updated cells / Compatibility notes for cell k+1 / Assumptions.

# 4. Code solution

## === cell 0
Your 0.5 score indicates the model is effectively producing near-constant predictions; the main cause here is that your text standardization is accidentally deleting the entire comment text (`regex_replace(lowercase, "", " ")` matches everywhere), so both vectorizers learn almost nothing. I’ll make the smallest fix by correctly removing HTML-like tags instead of deleting everything, keeping the same model, loss, and training loop. I’ll also set a fixed `random_state` in the train/val split to stabilize the result and avoid unlucky splits moving you away from the target. These changes should materially increase AUC toward your 0.9556 target while preserving the core approach.
