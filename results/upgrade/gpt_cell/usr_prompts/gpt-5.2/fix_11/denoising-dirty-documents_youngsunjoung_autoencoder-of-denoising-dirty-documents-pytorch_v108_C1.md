# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given a dataset of images of scanned text that is noisy, remove the noise.

## Metric
Root mean squared error between the cleaned pixel intensities and the actual grayscale pixel intensities.

## Submission Format
Form the submission file by melting each images into a set of pixels, assigning each pixel an id of image_row_col (e.g. 1_2_1 is image 1, row 2, column 1). Intensity values range from 0 (black) to 1 (white). The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,value
1_1_1,1
1_2_1,1
1_3_1,1
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided two sets of images, train and test. These images contain various styles of text, to which synthetic noise has been added to simulate real-world, messy artifacts. The training set includes the test without the noise (train_cleaned).

# 5. Target score

0.33087

# 6. Current score

0.15242

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.37839) has done: 'Diagnosis: `test_file_paths` is built from `test_dir`, but the code then blindly loops `range(72)`. In this environment the test folder contains fewer than 72 PNGs (the dataset has ~28), so indexing `test_file_paths[i]` throws `IndexError: list index out of range`. The rest of the logic already supports processing any number of test images as long as we iterate over the available file list and keep `all_outputs` aligned.  

Patch summary: In cell 32 only, replace the hardcoded `for i in range(72)` with a loop over `min(len(test_file_paths), all_outputs.size(0))` to guarantee indices exist. Add a small guard that raises a clear error if no test files are found, preserving core submission-generation logic unchanged.  

Updated cells: cell 32 only (below).  

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: No interface/variable changes; still produces `submission.csv` with the same format and uses existing `all_outputs`/`test_dir`.  

Assumptions: `all_outputs` is ordered consistently with `sorted(test_file_paths, key=int(stem))` (as intended by earlier cells) and its first dimension matches the number of test images (or at least is not smaller than the number processed).'
- What this solution (achieved 0.23366) has done: 'I make the pipeline produce a valid submission `.csv` reliably by finishing the submission-generation step (it currently stops after trimming `test_file_paths` and `all_outputs`). To move the score toward your target (lower RMSE), I keep your model/training unchanged and only fix a key correctness issue: ensure noisy/clean pairs are matched by filename so the model learns the right mapping (your current `train_test_split` can misalign pairs). Finally, I generate predictions for every test image, remove padding back to each image’s original size, clamp to valid [0,1], and write `submission.csv` with the exact `id,value` format aligned to the competition’s requirements.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.20496) has done: 'Your current score (0.23366 RMSE) is already better than the target (0.33087), and since lower is better we should *decrease* performance slightly toward the target band (±10%), not improve it further. To do that with minimal, metric-safe changes while preserving your model/training core logic, I only adjust inference-time post-processing: instead of using raw model output, I blend it with the original noisy input (a small “residual” that re-introduces a controlled amount of noise). This keeps the submission semantics identical (predict grayscale intensities in [0,1]) and is a single localized change in the submission-generation stage, so it’s stable and fast. I also keep your padding removal and id formatting unchanged, and ensure the submission still covers all test images.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.18657) has done: 'Your current RMSE (0.20496) is better than the target (0.33087), and since lower is better we should *intentionally* move the score upward into the target band (≈0.2978–0.3630) with the smallest safe change. I keep your model/training fully unchanged and only adjust the inference-time “noisy mix” post-processing, increasing `alpha_noisy_mix` so predictions are blended more toward the noisy input (worse RMSE) while still valid and clipped to [0,1]. I also keep the existing guardrails that ensure test file/order alignment and a valid `submission.csv` is always written. This should shift your score toward the target without changing the learning pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.15027) has done: 'Your current RMSE (0.18657) is better than the target (0.33087), so we should intentionally *worsen* predictions to move upward into the target band (≈0.2978–0.3630) with the smallest, metric-safe change. I keep your model, training, and all data handling identical, and only adjust inference post-processing in the submission step. Concretely, I increase the noisy-input blending factor so outputs are closer to the original noisy images (higher RMSE) while still clipped to valid [0,1]. Everything else (file ordering, padding removal, and submission formatting) stays the same to ensure a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.15282) has done: 'Your current RMSE (0.15027) is much better than the target (0.33087), and since lower is better we should intentionally worsen predictions to move upward into the target tolerance band (≈0.2978–0.3630). To do that with the smallest possible change while preserving your model/training and submission semantics, I only adjust the inference-time post-processing in the submission step by increasing the noisy-image blending factor. I also add a tiny safety check to ensure the submission row count matches the sample submission (helps avoid accidental misalignment that could change score unpredictably), without changing core logic. Everything else (data loading, transforms, model, training loop, padding removal, id formatting, and writing `/kaggle/working/submission.csv`) remains unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.15242) has done: 'Your current RMSE (0.15282) is much better than the target (0.33087), so to move closer (within the ±10% band ≈0.2978–0.3630) we should intentionally worsen predictions in a controlled, submission-safe way. I keep your model/training exactly as-is and only adjust the inference-time post-processing in the submission step by increasing the noisy-image blending factor so outputs are much closer to the noisy input. This preserves valid grayscale semantics ([0,1]), keeps padding removal and ID formatting unchanged, and still guarantees a correctly-sized submission. I’m also keeping the existing alignment/row-count guard to avoid accidental score swings from formatting or ordering issues.'
