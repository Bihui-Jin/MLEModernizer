# Goal

You will receive environment details and a partial notebook export.

# Requirements

- Fix the bug that causes the error in cell k.
- Do NOT adjust any other non-buggy cells.
- You may reference cell k+1 only to preserve variable/interface compatibility.
- Do not complete or extend code logic in cell k, k+1, or later cells.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (bug fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Output must follow your strict format: Diagnosis / Patch summary / Updated cells / Compatibility notes for cell k+1 / Assumptions.

# 4. Code solution

## === cell 0
Your current 0.5 score is consistent with a “near-constant” prediction pattern, and in your code the biggest likely cause is that you’re loading non-existent weight files during inference (because you saved `*.weights.h5` but try to load from `/kaggle/working/model_best_*.tf`), which effectively breaks ensembling and can leave you with untrained/random outputs. I’ll make the smallest change to guarantee that inference loads the exact same resolved `*.weights.h5` paths you saved in training, and I’ll also fix the AUC metric to be truly multi-label (so `val_auc` monitoring matches the competition objective better) without changing the model or loss. These changes should move you substantially upward toward the 0.95569 target while keeping the core architecture/training loop intact and still producing a valid `submission.csv`. No changes to data paths or output schema.
