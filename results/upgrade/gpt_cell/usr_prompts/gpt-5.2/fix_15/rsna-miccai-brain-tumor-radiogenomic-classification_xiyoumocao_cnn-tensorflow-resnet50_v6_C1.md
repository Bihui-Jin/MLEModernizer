# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

- What this solution (achieved 0.49353) has done: 'Diagnosis: Cell 10 crashes because it calls `model_best.predict(X_test)` but `X_test` (and its corresponding `testidt`) were never created in earlier cells; only helper functions exist to load test data. This is a simple missing-variable initialization issue, not a model/training problem.  

Patch summary: In cell 10, create `X_test` and `testidt` by calling the existing `get_all_data_for_test("FLAIR")`, then expand the channel dimension to match the model’s expected input shape (as done for train/valid). This keeps the rest of the submission-building logic unchanged and unblocks execution deterministically.  

Updated cells: Only cell 10 is modified.  

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: No cell 11 is provided; this patch preserves `result2` and `submission.csv` creation exactly as before, and defines `X_test/testidt` locally within cell 10 without changing any upstream interfaces.  

Assumptions: The intended test modality is the same one used for training (`"FLAIR"`), and test images should be shaped `(N, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 1)` like train/valid.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.49882) has done: 'You’re currently throwing away almost all AUC signal at inference by converting softmax probabilities into hard class labels via `argmax`, then averaging and rounding; for ROC-AUC you should submit continuous probabilities for the positive class. I keep your exact data loading, image selection, train/valid split, model architecture, loss, and training loop unchanged, and only adjust the validation scoring and test submission post-processing to use `y_pred[:, 1]` (probability of MGMT=1). I also remove the submission-time rounding (it harms AUC) while keeping the required CSV schema and row alignment to `sample_submission.csv`. These minimal changes should move your score upward toward the best your current trained model can express, without altering training semantics.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.50706) has done: 'Your current pipeline is already producing a valid submission and getting ~0.50 AUC, so the smallest safe way to move the score upward (without changing model/training logic) is to (1) use a patient-level train/valid split to eliminate slice-level leakage that inflates validation but hurts test generalization, and (2) ensure the ModelCheckpoint monitors the correct AUC name (`val_auc`) so you actually load the best epoch. These changes keep the same CNN, loss, optimizer, epochs, and per-slice training approach; they only change how indices are split and how the “best” model is selected. This typically improves real test AUC for this competition while preserving evaluation semantics (still submitting continuous probabilities). The submission format and paths remain unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.51882) has done: 'Your current AUC is only slightly above random (0.507), and the smallest reliable way to move it upward without changing the model/training loop is to make inference more robust. I (1) ensure the submission is fully populated (no NaNs) by filling missing IDs with 0.5, and (2) improve patient-level aggregation by using the median (more robust than mean for noisy slice probabilities) while keeping the same per-slice predictions and continuous probabilities required by ROC-AUC. I also add a stable, deterministic ordering check so the CSV aligns exactly to `sample_submission.csv` without changing any data paths or core modeling logic. These changes only affect post-processing/aggregation and should nudge public AUC upward toward a better score while preserving evaluation semantics.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'Your current code already trains and validates a model, but the submission is hardcoded to 0.5 for every test case, which keep AUC near random and prevents any score improvement. I keep your exact data loading, model, training loop, and patient-level aggregation logic intact, and only change the submission cell to actually run test inference and aggregate slice probabilities into patient-level probabilities (median, as you already use for validation). I also ensure the submission aligns exactly to `sample_submission.csv` order and contains no missing values by filling any missing IDs with 0.5. This should move the Kaggle AUC upward from the constant baseline while preserving your core approach and semantics.'
