# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.44529) has done: 'Diagnosis: The crash happens in cell 20 when calling `model_best.predict(X_test)` because `X_test` is a NumPy array with shape `(N, 32, 32)` (missing the channel dimension), while the model was built/trained with inputs shaped `(32, 32, 1)`. Keras then receives an input tensor with an unknown/incorrect shape and errors with `as_list() is not defined on an unknown TensorShape.` This mismatch didn’t surface earlier because only `X_train`/`X_valid` were expanded with a channel axis in cell 11; `X_test` was not. The minimal fix is to expand `X_test` in cell 20 (only if needed) to match the model’s expected input rank.

Patch summary: In cell 20, add a small shape-guard that expands `X_test` with `tf.expand_dims(..., axis=-1)` when it’s missing the channel dimension, then run prediction exactly as before.

Updated cells: (cell 20 only)

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: `pred`, `result`, and `testidt` keep the same meanings and shapes; `result = pd.DataFrame(testidt)` and downstream grouping in cell 21 remain unchanged.

Assumptions: The trained model expects a single-channel image input `(H, W, 1)` and `X_test` is currently either `(N, H, W)` or already `(N, H, W, 1)`; we only add the channel axis when necessary.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.42706) has done: 'Your current pipeline is outputting hard class labels (0/1 via `argmax`) and then averaging them, which collapses probability information and typically hurts ROC-AUC; the smallest score-improving change is to submit the class-1 probability instead. I keep the same data extraction, same model, and same checkpoint behavior, and only change prediction post-processing in validation and test to use `y_pred[:, 1]` (probability of MGMT=1) rather than `argmax`. I also keep the channel-dimension guard for `X_test` and add the same safe guard for `X_valid` to prevent shape inconsistencies. This should move the public AUC up from ~0.445 toward a more reasonable range without changing the model/training core logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.47412) has done: 'Your current target score (-1.0) is not achievable under this competition’s AUC metric (valid AUC is in \[0, 1\]), so the only sensible interpretation is “increase AUC” from the current 0.42706. The biggest issue in your script is that you never train the model when no checkpoint exists, so predictions come from an untrained network and AUC suffers; adding a standard `fit()` call keeps the exact same architecture/loss/metric and should improve AUC materially. I also ensure the checkpoint contains the best-validated model by training with the existing `ModelCheckpoint` callback and then reloading it for inference. All other data extraction, preprocessing, and submission aggregation remain unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.55647) has done: 'Your current AUC is below typical baselines for this competition, so we should make the smallest changes that legitimately improve generalization without changing the model/training “core.” The biggest controllable issue is that you are splitting at the slice level, which leaks patient identity across train/valid and makes checkpoint selection unreliable; switching to a patient-level split (same training loop, same model) yields a more meaningful validation signal and usually improves leaderboard AUC as well. I also exclude the known-bad training cases correctly by matching the 5-digit `BraTS21ID` strings, and I fix a subtle submission alignment bug by merging predictions onto `sample_submission` rather than overwriting IDs by position. These changes keep the architecture, loss, optimizer, and overall pipeline intact while improving correctness and stability.'
