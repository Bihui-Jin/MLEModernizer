# Goal

You will receive environment details and a partial notebook export.

# Requirements

- Fix the bug that causes the error in cell k.
- Do NOT adjust any other non-buggy cells.
- You may reference cell k+1 only to preserve variable/interface compatibility.
- Do not complete or extend code logic in cell k, k+1, or later cells.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (bug fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Output must follow your strict format: Diagnosis / Patch summary / Updated cells / Compatibility notes for cell k+1 / Assumptions.

## === cell 1
Diagnosis: The crash happens during `from keras.preprocessing import image` because this environment has Keras 3 (`keras==3.8.0`) alongside `tf_keras==2.18.0`, which can trigger a protobuf/TF backend mismatch leading to `AttributeError: 'MessageFactory' object has no attribute 'GetPrototype'` at import time. This is an import-time dependency issue, not a modeling bug. The minimal fix is to avoid importing the legacy `keras.preprocessing` module and instead use `tf_keras.preprocessing`, which is compatible with the installed TF/Keras stack. All other imports can stay the same to preserve the notebook’s core logic.

Patch summary: In cell 1 only, replace `from keras.preprocessing import image` with `from tf_keras.preprocessing import image` and keep the rest unchanged, so the variable name `image` remains available for later cells.

Updated cells: (cell 1 only)

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: Cell 2 only unzips data and does not depend on these imports; later cells that use `image` will still work because `image` is imported under the same name.

Assumptions: The environment supports `tf_keras` (it is installed as `tf_keras==2.18.0`) and the notebook does not rely on any Keras 3-only preprocessing APIs.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as img
import cv2

import os
import glob

from tf_keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.models import Model
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Activation, BatchNormalization, Flatten, Conv2D
from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D, Dropout, UpSampling2D

%matplotlib inline
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10.0, 5.0) # set default size of plots
