# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Use binary leaf images and extracted features to identify the species of plant.

## Metric
Multi-class log loss. 

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission Format
You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of leaf specimens which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. 

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. 

For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

### File descriptions
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **images/** - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields
- **id** - an anonymous id unique to an image
- **margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- **shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- **texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.09736) has done: 'The crash happens because `sklearn.cross_validation` was removed from scikit-learn; in your installed scikit-learn (1.2.2) the equivalent is in `sklearn.model_selection`. The minimal fix is to change the import to `from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit`. This preserves the exact intended splitter class and keeps downstream code semantics unchanged. No other logic is modified.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.09061) has done: 'Diagnosis: The crash happens because `StratifiedShuffleSplit`’s API has changed; in scikit-learn 1.2 it no longer accepts `(y, n_iter, ...)` positional arguments. The code is using the old pre-0.18 style constructor and iterating directly over the splitter, which now requires calling `.split(X, y)`.

Patch summary: Update cell 2 to construct `StratifiedShuffleSplit` with keyword arguments (`n_splits`, `test_size`, `random_state`) and iterate over `sss.split(train.values, labels)` to produce the same `train_index/test_index` outputs.

Updated cells: cell 2 only.

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` are still created with the same shapes/types as before, so downstream imports/usage remain unchanged.

Assumptions: We keep `n_splits=10` to match the original intent of “10 iterations”, and we preserve the last split from the loop as in the original code.'
