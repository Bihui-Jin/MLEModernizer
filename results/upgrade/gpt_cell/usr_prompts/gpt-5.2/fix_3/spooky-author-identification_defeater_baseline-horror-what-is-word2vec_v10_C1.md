# Goal

You will receive environment details and a partial notebook export.

# Requirements

- Fix the bug that causes the error in cell k.
- Do NOT adjust any other non-buggy cells.
- You may reference cell k+1 only to preserve variable/interface compatibility.
- Do not complete or extend code logic in cell k, k+1, or later cells.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (bug fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Output must follow your strict format: Diagnosis / Patch summary / Updated cells / Compatibility notes for cell k+1 / Assumptions.
