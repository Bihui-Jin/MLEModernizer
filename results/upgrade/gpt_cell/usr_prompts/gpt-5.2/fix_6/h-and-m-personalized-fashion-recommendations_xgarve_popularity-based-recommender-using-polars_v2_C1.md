# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
The training data is the purchase history of customers across time. The task is to predict what articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data ends.

## Metric
Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12):

$$
\text{MAP@12}=\frac{1}{U} \sum_{u=1}^U \frac{1}{\min (m, 12)} \sum_{k=1}^{\min (n, 12)} P(k) \times \text{rel}(k)
$$

where $U$ is the number of customers, $P(k)$ is the precision at cutoff $k, n$ is the number predictions per customer, $m$ is the number of ground truth values per customer, and $\text{rel}(k)$ is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank $k$ is a relevant (correct) label, zero otherwise.

You must make predictions for all `customer_id` values found in the sample submission. All customers who made purchases during the test period are scored, regardless of whether they had purchase history in the training data.

## Submission Format
For each `customer_id` observed in the training data, you may predict up to 12 labels for the `article_id`, which is the predicted items a customer will buy in the next 7-day period after the training time period. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
customer_id,prediction
00000dba,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
0000423b,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
...
```

## Dataset
- **images/** - a folder of images corresponding to each `article_id`; images are placed in subfolders starting with the first three digits of the `article_id`; note, not all `article_id` values have a corresponding image.
- **articles.csv** - detailed metadata for each `article_id` available for purchase
- **customers.csv** - metadata for each `customer_id` in dataset
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **transactions_train.csv** - the training data, consisting of the purchases each customer for each date, as well as additional information. Duplicate rows correspond to multiple purchases of the same item. Your task is to predict the `article_id`s each customer will purchase during the 7-day period immediately after the training data period.

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Diagnosis: The crash in cell 3 is a Polars `SchemaError` triggered when concatenating `personal_top_<=12` with `global_top_12`. `personal_top_<=12` is a `list[i64]`, but `global_top_12` is currently created as a nested list (`list[list[i64]]`) because of `pl.lit([most_popular_articles])`. Polars cannot find a common supertype between `i64` and `list[i64]` during `concat_list`, so execution fails.

Patch summary: Change the literal construction of `global_top_12` to be a single-level list column (`list[i64]`) by using `pl.lit(most_popular_articles)` instead of wrapping it in an extra list. This preserves the same intended semantics (append global top-12 to each row) and keeps the output column names/format identical for cell 4.

Updated cells: Only cell 3 is modified.

Compatibility notes for cell k+1: `improved_submission` remains a Polars DataFrame with columns `customer_id` and `prediction` (string of space-joined article_ids), so `improved_submission.write_csv("submission.csv")` in cell 4 continues to work unchanged.

Assumptions: `most_popular_articles` is a Python `list[int]` (as produced in cell 1) and `article_id` values fit in Polars `Int64`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your score is 0.0 because the submission likely contains invalid `article_id` formatting: the code currently prefixes every id with an extra `"0"`, turning e.g. `108775015` into `"0108775015"` which won’t match the ground-truth `article_id` strings used for scoring. I keep the same popularity-based logic but change only the final formatting step to output 10-digit, zero-padded article ids (the competition’s expected format) without adding an extra leading digit. This should move the score up toward your target with minimal risk and no change to the recommendation logic. The output file remains `submission.csv` with the required columns.'
