# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

# 7. Whether higher score is better

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the protobuf/TensorFlow import crash by removing the forced pure-Python protobuf environment settings that are incompatible with the Kaggle runtime, letting TensorFlow use its default compatible protobuf implementation. Then I make inference robust to missing external pretrained weights/models: if no fold weight files are found under `LOAD_MODELS_FROM`, the script fall back to a valid uniform-probability submission (still correctly normalized and formatted), ensuring a `.csv` is always produced. I also adjust the cell numbering to start at 1 (as required) and add small guards so the pipeline doesn’t reference missing local `train.csv`/preprocess artifacts when `NEEDTRAIN=False` on Kaggle. These changes are score-neutral in the missing-weights case (it submit a baseline rather than error), and they unblock end-to-end execution.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the crash happening before any training/inference by making TensorFlow import safe under the Kaggle runtime (the protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` issue) via a minimal, targeted protobuf version pin executed before importing TensorFlow. Then, since your current Kaggle score (1.40995, lower-is-better) is far from the target (0.3141), I also remove the “uniform-probability fallback” path and instead enable training on Kaggle so the script produces real predictions (this keeps the model architecture/training loop intact, just changes the control flag). Finally, I ensure the submission is always written as `submission.csv` with correct columns and row-wise normalization.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the runtime crash in training by updating the `ModelCheckpoint` filepaths to comply with current Keras requirements when `save_weights_only=True` (they must end with `.weights.h5`), and update the corresponding `load_weights()` and inference weight filename expectations to match. I also add a minimal safeguard so the cosine LR schedule never divides by zero when `total_step == warm_step` (can happen with small epoch counts in stage2), which is stability-only. These changes preserve the exact model/training logic but allow training to complete and produce real predictions instead of the low-scoring fallback, which should move the score substantially toward the target. Finally, the script still always write a valid `submission.csv` with correctly normalized probabilities.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'You’re crashing during model construction because the code tries to load EfficientNet “notop” pretrained weights from `/kaggle/input/pre-trained-weights/…`, but that dataset isn’t present in your environment. To keep the core model/training logic identical while unblocking training (and improving score vs the current weak fallback), I make the pretrained-weight loading conditional on the file actually existing; otherwise it proceed with `weights=None` as already defined. I also ensure the inference phase builds the model without attempting to load missing pretrained weights (same conditional), and I keep the submission writing/normalization unchanged so it always produces a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'Main bottlenecks are (1) training being enabled by default (5 folds × 2 stages × EfficientNetV2B0 is far beyond 600s) and (2) extremely expensive test-time preprocessing due to repeatedly running SciPy `filtfilt+spectrogram` per file without parallelism and with extra work inside `DataGenerator` (notably `np.where` scanning STFT time for every sample). To fit a hard 600s budget while preserving the exact inference/training logic, the script below defaults to inference-only (loads provided fold weights if present) and makes test preprocessing faster but equivalent by caching per-eeg STFT crop indices and avoiding repeated `np.where` scans. It also removes unnecessary pip installs, reduces overhead in Keras `fit/predict` multiprocessing (which is slow in Kaggle), and enables `tf.data` prefetching via `Sequence` settings while keeping deterministic seeds and identical model/feature math. If weights are missing, it still falls back to the same uniform baseline submission behavior as your original code.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` import crash by switching to the Kaggle-stable pure-Python protobuf implementation *before* importing TensorFlow (this is the minimal change that unblocks the whole pipeline in this runtime). I also make weight-loading for inference robust to both possible Keras weight suffixes (`.weights.h5` and legacy `.h5`) so inference uses real trained weights when present instead of falling back to uniform predictions (which should improve score toward your target). Finally, I keep the submission writing identical but add a hard safety check that the saved file ends with `.csv` and that each row sums to 1.'
