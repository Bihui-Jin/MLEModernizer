# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given questions and answers from various StackExchange properties, predict target values of 30 labels for each question-answer pair.

## Metric
Mean column-wise Spearman's correlation coefficient. The Spearman's rank correlation is computed for each target column, and the mean of these values is calculated for the submission score.

## Submission Format
For each qa_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each target variable. The predictions should be in the range [0,1]. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
qa_id,question_asker_intent_understanding,...,answer_well_written
6,0.0,...,0.5
8,0.5,...,0.1
18,1.0,...,0.0
etc.
```

## Dataset
The list of 30 target labels are the same as the column names in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Target labels with the prefix `question_` relate to the `question_title` and/or `question_body` features in the data. Target labels with the prefix `answer_` relate to the `answer` feature.

Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range `[0,1]`. Therefore, predictions must also be in that range.

- **train.csv** - the training data (target labels are the last 30 columns)
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict 30 labels for each test set row)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format; column names are the 30 target labels

# 5. Target score

# 6. Current score

nan

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved nan) has done: 'I fix the environment-breaking import/compatibility issue by avoiding `tqdm_notebook` and TensorFlow/Keras model loading, which currently fails due to missing model files and a protobuf/Keras incompatibility. To produce a valid end-to-end submission without external artifacts, I replace the missing pre-trained model/tokenizer with a minimal, self-contained baseline that reads the CSVs, builds the correct 30 target columns from `sample_submission.csv`, and outputs valid `[0,1]` predictions aligned to `qa_id`. This ensure a `submission.csv` is always generated with the correct header/shape and no runtime errors. The baseline uses train-set target means (a stable, score-reasonable fallback for Spearman) and clips to `[0,1]` to satisfy the competition constraints.'
