# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 2. Python version

# 3. Installed packages

# 5. Target score

0.542835288118307

# 6. Current score

0.46353

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.46353) has done: 'I fix the immediate import/runtime failure by removing the incompatible `keras.utils.vis_utils` import that triggers the protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` error in this environment, while keeping TensorFlow/Keras usage intact. I also remove the hard dependency on an external pre-trained model file that doesn’t exist (`/kaggle/input/model-test/model_V1.h5`) by training the provided `DeepScanModel` on the competition training set and then using it for test inference (same architecture/loss/optimizer/metric). To ensure the pipeline finishes and produces a valid `.csv`, I add a small, deterministic train/validation split, compile+fit, and then write `submission.csv` with the exact required columns. These changes are directly to unblock execution and produce a legitimate AUC-based probability submission.'
