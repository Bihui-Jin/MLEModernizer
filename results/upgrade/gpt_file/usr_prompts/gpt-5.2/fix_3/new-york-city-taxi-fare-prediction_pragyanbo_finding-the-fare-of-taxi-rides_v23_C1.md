# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the fare amount for a taxi ride given the pickup and dropoff locations.

## Metric
Root mean-squared error.

## Submission Format
For each `key` in the test set, you must predict a value for the `fare_amount` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
key,fare_amount
2015-01-27 13:08:24.0000002,11.00
2015-02-27 13:08:24.0000002,12.05
2015-03-27 13:08:24.0000002,11.23
2015-04-27 13:08:24.0000002,14.17
2015-05-27 13:08:24.0000002,15.12
etc
```

## Dataset
- **train.csv** - Input features and target `fare_amount` values for the training set (about 55M rows).
- **test.csv** - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict `fare_amount` for each row.
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format (columns `key` and `fare_amount`). This file 'predicts' `fare_amount` to be $`11.35` for all rows, which is the mean `fare_amount` from the training set.

### Data fields
**ID**

- **key** - Unique `string` identifying each row in both the training and test sets. Comprised of **pickup_datetime** plus a unique integer, but this doesn't matter, it should just be used as a unique ID field.Required in your submission CSV. Not necessarily needed in the training set, but could be useful to simulate a 'submission file' while doing cross-validation within the training set.

**Features**

- **pickup_datetime** - `timestamp` value indicating when the taxi ride started.
- **pickup_longitude** - `float` for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
- **pickup_latitude** - `float` for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
- **dropoff_longitude** - `float` for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
- **dropoff_latitude** - `float` for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
- **passenger_count** - `integer` indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.

**Target**

- **fare_amount** - `float` dollar amount of the cost of the taxi ride. This value is only in the training set; this is what you are predicting in the test set and it is required in your submission CSV.

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 5.89776) has done: 'I fix the XGBoost prediction call to be compatible with xgboost==2.0.3: `best_ntree_limit` is no longer available, so we use `iteration_range` (or fall back safely) based on `best_iteration` from early stopping. I also make the script runnable as a .py (Kaggle script) by removing the Jupyter-only `%matplotlib inline` magic while keeping the same imports and core logic. Finally, I ensure a submission file is always written with the required columns and a `.csv` suffix, even if early stopping metadata differs.'
- What this solution (achieved 5.89866) has done: 'To move RMSE down toward the 4.38819 target (lower is better) with minimal disruption, I keep your exact feature set and XGBoost training approach but fix two high-impact issues: the train/validation split be made deterministic and the XGBoost parameters be updated to sensible defaults for xgboost==2.0.3 (while keeping the same training API and early stopping). I also make the split and training consistent by setting seeds in both `train_test_split` and XGBoost, which typically improves generalization and reduces score variance. Finally, I add a tiny, safe clamp of predictions to a non-negative range (fares can’t be negative), which usually helps RMSE without changing your core logic.'
