# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Identify fractures in CT scans of the cervical spine (neck) at both the level of a single vertebrae and the entire patient.

## Metric
Weighted multi-label logarithmic loss. Each fracture sub-type is its own row for every exam, and you are expected to predict a probability for a fracture at each of the seven cervical vertebrae designated as C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7. There is also an any label, `patient_overall`, which indicates that a fracture of ANY kind described before exists in the examination. Fractures in the skull base, thoracic spine, ribs, and clavicles are ignored. The any label is weighted more highly than specific fracture level sub-types.

For each exam Id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (a separate row for each cervical level subtype). We then take the log loss for each predicted probability versus its true label.

The binary weighted log loss function for label j on exam i is specified as:

$$
L_{i j}=-w_j *\left[y_{i j} * \log \left(p_{i j}\right)+\left(1-y_{i j}\right) * \log \left(1-p_{i j}\right)\right]
$$

Finally, loss is averaged across all rows.

## Submission Format
There will be 8 rows per image Id. The label indicated by a particular row will look like [image Id]_[Sub-type Name], as follows. There is also a target column, `fractured`, indicating the probability of whether a fracture exists at the specified level. For each image ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the different possible sub-types and the patient overall. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
row_id,fractured
1_C1,0
1_C2,0
1_C3,0
1_C4,0.6
1_C5,0
1_C6,0.9
1_C7,0.01
1_patient_overall,0.99
2_C1,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train test set.

- `StudyInstanceUID` - The study ID. There is one unique study ID for each patient scan.
- `patient_overall` - One of the target columns. The patient level outcome, i.e. if any of the vertebrae are fractured.
- `C[1-7]` - The other target columns. Whether the given vertebrae is fractured. See [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column#/media/File:Gray_111_-_Vertebral_column-coloured.png) for the real location of each vertbrae in the spine.

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set prediction structure. Only the first few rows of the test set are available for download.

- `row_id` - The row ID. This will match the same column in the sample submission file.
- `StudyInstanceUID` - The study ID.
- `prediction_type` - Which one of the eight target columns needs a prediction in this row.

**[train/test]_images/[StudyInstanceUID]/[slice_number].dcm** The image data, organized with one folder per scan. Expect to see roughly 1,500 scans in the hidden test set.\

Each image is in [the dicom file format](https://www.dicomstandard.org/). The DICOM image files are ≤ 1 mm slice thickness, axial orientation, and bone kernel. Note that some of the DICOM files are JPEG compressed. You may require additional resources to read the pixel array of these files, such as GDCM and pylibjpeg.

**sample_submission.csv** A valid sample submission.

- `row_id` - The row ID. See the test.csv for what prediction needs to be filed in that row.
- `fractured` - The target column.

**train_bounding_boxes.csv** Bounding boxes for a subset of the training set.

**segmentations/** Pixel level annotations for a subset of the training set. This data is provided in the [nifti file format](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/).

A portion of the imaging datasets have been segmented automatically using a 3D UNET model, and radiologists modified and approved the segmentations. The provided segmentation labels have values of 1 to 7 for C1 to C7 (seven cervical vertebrae) and 8 to 19 for T1 to T12 (twelve thoracic vertebrae are located in the center of your upper and middle back), and 0 for everything else. As we focused on the cervical spine, all scans have C1 to C7 labels but not all thoracic labels.

Please be aware that the NIFTI files consist of segmentation in the sagittal plane, while the DICOM files are in the axial plane. Please use the NIFTI header information to determine the appropriate orientation such that the DICOM images and segmentation match. Otherwise, you run the risk of having the segmentations flipped in the Z axis and mirrored in the X axis.

# 6. Current score

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.5635) has done: 'The failures come from relying on an extra `../input/srccode/src` codebase (and model/plan files) that are not present in your provided environment, so `NNUnetCTPredictor` and related utilities never import. To make the notebook run end-to-end and still produce a valid submission, I replace those missing dependencies with a minimal, deterministic baseline that uses only the provided CSV metadata and outputs well-calibrated constant probabilities per label. I also fix the submission generation to strictly follow `test.csv`/`sample_submission.csv` row ordering (so it always matches the required 14536 rows and `row_id` values). This is score-oriented but conservative: it won’t crash, and it should beat an invalid/no-submission while staying within the competition’s expected format.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.55969) has done: 'Your current solution is a constant-per-label prior baseline, and the main way to move the weighted logloss down (better) without changing the overall approach is to calibrate those constants to the metric. I keep the same “predict a constant probability per `prediction_type`” core logic, but (1) compute smoothed priors with a tunable strength and (2) apply a tiny, label-wise shrink toward 0.5 to reduce overconfidence—both are safe, deterministic, and often improve logloss. I also compute `patient_overall` consistently from the vertebra priors (probability of any fracture) and lightly blend it with the empirical `patient_overall` rate to better match its semantics and higher weight. Submission generation and row alignment remain identical to your current code.'
