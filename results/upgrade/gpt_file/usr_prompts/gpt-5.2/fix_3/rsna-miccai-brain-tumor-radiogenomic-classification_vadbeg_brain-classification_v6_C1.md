# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 2. Python version

3.9

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 5. Target score

-1.0

# 6. Current score

0.5

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the runtime failure by making the script robust to the missing external checkpoint: it look for a checkpoint in standard Kaggle input locations, and if none is found it fall back to an untrained model (still producing a valid submission CSV). I also fix the test-folder glob so it works regardless of whether Kaggle mounts the dataset under `/kaggle/input/...` or a different root, and I ensure the submission is written to a `.csv` file with the exact required columns. These changes are minimal and do not alter the model architecture or inference semantics when a checkpoint is available; they only unblock execution end-to-end.'
