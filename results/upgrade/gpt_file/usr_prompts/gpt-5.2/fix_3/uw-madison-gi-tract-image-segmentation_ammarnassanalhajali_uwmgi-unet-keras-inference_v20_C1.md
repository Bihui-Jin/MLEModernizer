# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a model to automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans.

## Metric
Mean Dice coefficient and 3D Hausdorff distance. 

The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by:

$$
\frac{2 \cdot |X \cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|}
$$

where $X$ is the predicted set of pixels and $Y$ is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 0 when both $X$ and $Y$ are empty. 

Hausdorff distance is a method for calculating the distance between segmentation objects A and B, by calculating the furthest point on object A from the nearest point on object B. For 3D Hausdorff, we construct 3D volumes by combining each 2D segmentation with slice depth as the Z coordinate and then find the Hausdorff distance between them. (Here the slice depth for all scans is set to 1). The expected / predicted pixel locations are normalized by image size to create a bounded 0-1 score.

The two metrics are combined, with a weight of 0.4 for the Dice metric and 0.6 for the Hausdorff distance.

## Submission Format
Use run-length encoding on the pixel values.  Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the mask should be binary, meaning the masks for all objects in an image are joined into a single large mask. A value of 0 should indicate pixels that are not masked, and a value of 1 will indicate pixels that are masked.

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,class,predicted
1,large_bowel,1 1 5 1
1,small_bowel,1 1
1,stomach,1 1
2,large_bowel,1 5 2 17
etc.
```

## Dataset
Each case is represented by multiple sets of scan slices (each set is identified by the day the scan took place). Some cases are split by time (early days are in train, later days are in test) while some cases are split by case - the entirety of the case is in train or test. The goal is to be able to generalize to both partially and wholly unseen cases.

### Files
- train.csv - IDs and masks for all training objects.
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- train - a folder of case/day folders, each containing slice images for a particular case on a given day.

Note that the image filenames include 4 numbers (ex. 276_276_1.63_1.63.png). These four numbers are slice width / height (integers in pixels) and width/height pixel spacing (floating points in mm). The first two defines the resolution of the slide. The last two record the physical size of each pixel.

Physical pixel thickness in superior-inferior direction is 3mm.

### Columns
- `id` - unique identifier for object
- `class` - the predicted class for the object
- `segmentation` - RLE-encoded pixels for the identified object

# 2. Python version

3.10

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

Higher is better

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.00459) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation early, which resolves the `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` error in many Kaggle images. Then I remove the missing external model dependency (`../input/uwmgi-unet-keras/model.h5`) by replacing it with a tiny, deterministic fallback Keras model that preserves the same I/O semantics (128×128×3 → 128×128×3 sigmoid) so the pipeline runs end-to-end. Finally, I fix the submission-length mismatch by generating predictions for the full `sample_submission` rows (not every 3rd row) and by writing RLEs aligned exactly to the sample ordering, producing a valid `submission.csv`.'
