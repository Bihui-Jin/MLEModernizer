# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 6. Current score

0.0

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I fix the runtime errors by making device selection robust (CPU fallback when CUDA isn’t available) and by ensuring model weight loading uses a compatible `map_location`. I also make inference deterministic/stable by using `torch.inference_mode()` and proper RGB conversion, and I prevent crashes if any optional model checkpoint paths don’t exist by skipping missing models rather than failing. Finally, I guarantee a valid `submission.csv` by aligning predictions to `test.csv` order and always producing the required `id_code,diagnosis` columns, keeping your existing ensembling and thresholding semantics intact.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is almost certainly coming from submitting a file where all predictions are 0 because neither checkpoint loads in the Kaggle environment (your paths point to datasets that don’t exist here). I keep your exact model definitions, inference flow (including TTA flip), and the same thresholding, but I (1) auto-detect valid checkpoint files under `/kaggle/input` and load the first matching one for each architecture, and (2) also apply the correct ImageNet normalization for the DenseNet branch (it currently uses only `ToTensor()`, which usually tanks DR performance). These are minimal changes that should turn the submission from an “all zeros” fallback into real model-based predictions and move QWK upward toward your target. The script still guarantees a valid `submission.csv` aligned to `test.csv` and finishes within the time limit.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is almost certainly because no usable checkpoints are actually being loaded (so you fall back to predicting all zeros), or because the checkpoint keys don’t match your model (e.g., `module.` or Lightning `state_dict` prefixes) so `strict=True` silently prevents loading in your earlier runs. I keep your exact model definitions, inference (including flip TTA), ensembling, and thresholds, but make checkpoint discovery more reliable in `/kaggle/input` and make `safe_load_state_dict` robust to common key-prefix formats while still requiring all model weights to match (so we don’t run with partially-loaded weights). I also ensure the loaded checkpoint is actually used (and print a short sanity summary) so the submission is not the all-zero fallback. These minimal changes should move QWK up substantially toward your target by restoring real model-based predictions.'
