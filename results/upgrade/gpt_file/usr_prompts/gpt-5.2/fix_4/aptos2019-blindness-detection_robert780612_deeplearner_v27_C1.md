# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 5. Target score

0.8995050092436975

# 6. Current score

0.0

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I fix the runtime by making the code device-agnostic (CPU fallback when no GPU is available) and by ensuring inference runs under `torch.no_grad()` to avoid unnecessary overhead. I also correct the Kaggle input paths so the pretrained `.pth` files are found in this dataset (and gracefully handle missing model files by skipping that model instead of crashing). Then I make prediction order deterministic by reading `test.csv` and mapping `id_code -> prediction`, so the submission aligns exactly with the required row order. Finally, I ensure the script always writes a valid `submission.csv` with the correct columns and integer class predictions.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.00297) has done: 'Your current 0.0 score is most consistent with the submission being misaligned with `test.csv` (IDs not matching due to whitespace/hidden characters) and/or both external model files not being found so you end up submitting all zeros. I make two minimal changes that preserve the model and inference logic: (1) auto-detect the dataset root path that actually exists in your environment so the test images load reliably, and (2) sanitize `id_code` in both `test.csv` and the prediction keys to guarantee a perfect merge/order match. I also fail over to an available built-in torchvision ImageNet model (no extra training) only if neither `.pth` is found, so you don’t submit all zeros again; this is a small, legitimate improvement path that should move the score up from 0.0 toward your target. The thresholding and core model architectures/loss/training remain unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your score (-0.00297) is far below the target (0.8995), so the priority is to make the predictions meaningful rather than effectively random/misaligned. The biggest issue is that the current “fallback” uses an ImageNet classifier and maps 1000-class probabilities to DR grades, which is not semantically valid and can easily yield near-random kappa; instead, we should only generate predictions from the intended DR regression models and otherwise fail loudly or (minimally) produce a safer constant baseline. I also make sure we correctly locate the two pretrained `.pth` files by searching under `/kaggle/input/*` (datasets can be mounted under different names), while keeping the exact same model definitions and inference logic. Finally, I keep your `id_code` sanitization and merge/order alignment intact to prevent accidental row mismatch.'
