# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Provided with images of chemicals, predict the corresponding International Chemical Identifier (InChI) text string of the image.

## Metric
Mean [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between the InChi strings you submit and the ground truth InChi values.

## Submission Format
For each `image_id` in the test set, you must predict the InChi string of the molecule in the corresponding image. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_id,InChI
00000d2a601c,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
00001f7fc849,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
000037687605,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - the training images, arranged in a 3-level folder structure by `image_id`
- **test/** - the test images, arranged in the same folder structure as `train/`
- **train_labels.csv** - ground truth InChi labels for the training images
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 5. Target score

69.13

# 6. Current score

114.7817

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 114.7817) has done: 'Your code currently can’t reliably yield a Kaggle score because it’s extremely likely to time out before producing `submission.csv` (it computes huge numbers of Levenshtein distances during the precompute step). To move toward the target score while keeping the same core logic (a constant-string baseline), the smallest safe change is to remove the expensive genetic-algorithm search and instead choose a constant InChI string directly from the training distribution that should reduce average Levenshtein distance. Specifically, we use the most frequent `InChI` in `train_labels.csv` (mode), which is a legitimate minimal baseline improvement and runs quickly. The rest of the submission-writing logic is preserved, and it always write a valid `submission.csv` with the correct columns and row count.'
