# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf.

## Metric
Categorization accuracy.

## Submission Format
```
image_id,label
1000471002.jpg,4
1000840542.jpg,4
etc.
```

## Dataset
**[train/test]_images** the image files.

**train.csv**

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the ID code for the disease.

**sample_submission.csv** A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the predicted ID code for the disease.

**[train/test]_tfrecords** the image files in tfrecord format.

**label_num_to_disease_map.json** The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

# 2. Python version

3.9

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 5. Target score

0.8661226956784527

# 6. Current score

0.61099

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.61099) has done: 'I fix execution by (1) addressing the protobuf/TensorFlow import crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation before importing TensorFlow, and (2) removing the dependency on the missing `/kaggle/input/f-models` models by switching to a minimal, local baseline that still produces a valid `submission.csv`. To keep changes minimal and stable, the baseline predict the majority class from `train.csv`, which is score-reasonable for Cassava and avoids training time. I also make the data path resolution robust to either `/kaggle/input/...` or `/kaggle/data/...` layouts while keeping the existing intended paths. Finally, I ensure the submission file is written with the exact required columns and row alignment.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.41741) has done: 'The crash happens before any training/prediction because importing TensorFlow triggers a protobuf incompatibility (`MessageFactory.GetPrototype` missing). Since this baseline doesn’t actually use TensorFlow/Keras, the smallest and most stable fix is to remove the TensorFlow/Keras imports entirely so the pipeline runs end-to-end and writes `submission.csv`. To move the score toward your target without changing the “no-training baseline” approach, I replace the pure majority-class guess with a slightly better prior-based predictor: sample labels according to the empirical class distribution from `train.csv` (seeded for determinism). This keeps the same simple semantics (no image usage, no model training) but should improve expected accuracy vs always predicting the single majority class. The script still validate paths and submission format and write a valid `/kaggle/working/submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.61099) has done: 'Your current solution samples labels from the global class prior, which has expected accuracy equal to the sum of squared class frequencies and is typically low for Cassava—explaining the 0.417 score. To move toward the 0.866 target with minimal change and without introducing training loops or image modeling, I keep the “no-training baseline” approach but switch to a deterministic, higher-accuracy heuristic: always predict the majority class from `train.csv`. This preserves the same overall semantics (no image use, no model), is stable/deterministic, and should substantially increase accuracy on this dataset relative to random prior sampling. I also keep the same path checks and ensure the submission format stays identical.'
