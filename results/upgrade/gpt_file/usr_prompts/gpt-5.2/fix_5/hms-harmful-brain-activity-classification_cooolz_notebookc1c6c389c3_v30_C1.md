# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

# 5. Target score

0.4392794798070529

# 6. Current score

1.40995

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the path/weights handling so the notebook no longer crashes when the external weight directories are missing or contain subfolders, and so `torch.load` is only called on actual model files. Because your current run cannot yield a submission, I add a safe fallback that produces a valid probability submission (row-wise sum to 1) even when no weights are available in the environment, without changing the model definitions or inference logic. I also ensure the predictions array always has shape `(len(test_df), 6)` and is properly normalized before writing `submission.csv`. These changes are score-neutral in intent (they unblock execution); if weights are present, the code use them as originally intended.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'Your current score (1.40995, lower-is-better) is far from the target (0.43928), so we should improve performance while keeping your architecture and inference logic intact. The biggest issue is that you only run the EEG model, even if spectrogram and mix weights exist; enabling the existing Spec/Mix inference paths and then averaging the three prediction streams is a minimal, legitimate improvement that typically reduces KL a lot. I also make the DataLoader more deterministic/stable (no behavior change in math) and ensure we always normalize/clamp probabilities safely for a valid submission. No training is added; we only use the same models you already defined and the weights you already point to.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'Your current score (1.40995, lower-is-better) is much worse than the target (0.43928), so we should improve predictions with the smallest legitimate changes that keep your model definitions and inference intact. The biggest likely issue is that test-time stochasticity is still enabled because the models are never put into `eval()` mode until inside the inference loop, after dropout layers are already constructed (but eval should still disable them); more importantly, BatchNorm running stats can differ if any accidental train-mode is used—so we force `model.eval()` immediately after loading weights and also disable any nondeterministic CuDNN behavior for stability. Next, we fix a subtle but impactful input mismatch: `NetSpec` is defined with `in_chans=3` but the dataset returns 4 channels; your forward slices 4 regions and then makes RGB by repetition, so it should still work, but we ensure the spec tensor is exactly what the model expects by explicitly selecting only 4 regions and not relying on silent shape quirks. Finally, we do a minimal, metric-aligned probability floor (slightly higher than 1e-9) to reduce extreme KL penalties from near-zero probabilities while still preserving normalization and semantics.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'Your current score (1.40995, lower-is-better) is far from the target (0.43928), so we should improve the prediction quality with minimal, safe changes that don’t alter your model architectures or training/inference approach. The biggest likely issue is that the test spectrogram parsing has a bug: the `r` pointer never advances, so all 4 “regions” are extracted from the same time window, hurting `NetSpec` and `NetMix`; fixing this should materially reduce KL while preserving intended semantics. Second, `NetMix` uses an `hrnet_w18` backbone but a hardcoded `Linear(2048,6)` head, which is very likely a dimension mismatch with real weights; we keep the backbone but make the classifier input dimension adaptive from the actual backbone output to correctly load and use your existing weights. Finally, we keep your probability clipping/normalization but add a tiny post-ensemble temperature smoothing (very mild) to reduce overconfident near-zero probabilities that are heavily penalized by KL, which typically improves KL without changing the overall logic.'
