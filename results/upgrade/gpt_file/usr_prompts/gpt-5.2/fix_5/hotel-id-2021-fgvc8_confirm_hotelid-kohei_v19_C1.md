# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Identify hotels from images.

## Metric
Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5)

## Submission Format
For each image in the test set, you must predict a space-delimited list of hotel IDs that could match that image. The first ID should be the most relevant one and the last the least relevant one. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image,hotel_id
99e91ad5f2870678.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
b5cc62ab665591a9.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
d5664a972d5a644b.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
```

## Dataset
**train.csv** - The training set metadata.

- `image` - The image ID.

- `chain` - An ID code for the hotel chain. A `chain` of zero (0) indicates that the hotel is either not part of a chain or the chain is not known. This field is not available for the test set. The number of hotels per chain varies widely.

- `hotel_id` - The hotel ID. The target class.

- `timestamp` - When the image was taken. Provided for the training set only.

**sample_submission.csv** - A sample submission file in the correct format.

- `image` The image ID

- `hotel_id` The hotel ID. The target class.

**train_images** - The training set contains 97000+ images from around 7700 hotels from across the globe. All of the images for each hotel chain are in a dedicated subfolder for that chain.

**test_images** - The test set images. This competition has a hidden test set: only three images are provided here as samples while the remaining 13,000 images will be available to your notebook once it is submitted.

# 2. Python version

0.00209

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.00209) has done: 'Your current notebook never yields a score because it relies on private Kaggle Dataset wheels (`/kaggle/input/pekolib*`) that are not present in the provided environment, so the install/import step fail before writing `submission.csv`. To unblock scoring with minimal change, I remove the external wheel installs and replace the `peko` call with a simple, fully self-contained baseline that still produces a valid `submission.csv` in the required format. Since MAP@5 requires 5 space-delimited hotel IDs per image, the baseline predict the 5 most frequent `hotel_id`s from `train.csv` for every test image (a common safe fallback that typically scores non-trivially above random). This keeps I/O paths Kaggle-compatible and guarantees an end-to-end run and a valid submission file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00209) has done: 'Your current baseline predicts the same global top-5 hotels for every test image, which usually yields a very low MAP@5. To move the score toward the 0.745 target with minimal core-logic change, I keep the “no-ML” approach but make predictions image-specific using only train.csv: for each test image, infer its chain folder (the parent directory in `test_images/`) and use the top-5 hotels within that chain from the training metadata, falling back to global top-5 if needed. This leverages the dataset’s provided folder structure without changing any model/training code (there is none) and typically gives a large, legitimate lift in MAP@5. I also ensure the submission includes all test images (including nested directories) and exactly 5 space-delimited IDs per row.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00105) has done: 'Your current score is far below the target, so we should legitimately increase MAP@5 with the smallest possible change while keeping the same “metadata-only, no-ML” core approach. The main issue is that for this competition the test images are *not* organized into chain-number folders (unlike train), so your chain-folder heuristic almost never triggers and you effectively fall back to the same global top-5 for most images. I keep the same prediction strategy structure (top-5 by group with fallback), but switch the grouping key to something actually available at inference: the test image’s *nearest neighbors in filename space* using the shared image-ID prefix (first 1–4 hex chars) and using the top-5 hotels among training images with the same prefix bucket; if no matches, fall back to global top-5. This remains fully self-contained, fast, and typically improves over pure global-frequency while still preserving your simple baseline semantics and producing a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00209) has done: 'Your current approach is “metadata-only top-5 by bucket with global fallback”, but the filename-prefix buckets don’t correlate with hotel IDs, so MAP@5 stays near-random. To move sharply toward the 0.745 target without changing the overall non-ML nature, I keep the same “top-5 by group with fallback” core logic but switch the grouping key to something that *does* carry signal at inference: the test image’s parent folder name (chain directory), matching how train images are organized. I also ensure we correctly handle both possible test directory layouts (flat vs chain-subfolders) and always emit exactly 5 IDs per row in the original sample_submission order when available. This is a minimal, legitimate change that typically yields a large score jump because chain narrows candidate hotels substantially.'
