# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -24.65932) has done: 'I fix the runtime errors caused by deprecated `DataFrame.append` (pandas 2.x) by replacing it with `pd.concat` while preserving the same data construction logic. I also fix the missing pretrained weight file by adding a safe fallback: if the checkpoint path does not exist, the model run with randomly initialized weights so the notebook still completes and writes a valid `submission.csv`. To prevent GPU/CPU loading issues, I load weights with `map_location` and ensure tensors are on the right device inside `make_eval_data`. Finally, I ensure the produced submission matches `sample_submission.csv` row order and required columns, and always clips `Confidence` to at least 70 as required by the metric.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.65875) has done: 'Your current score is very low because the pretrained checkpoint is missing, so you are effectively submitting random predictions. The smallest change that legitimately moves the score toward the target is to remove that dependency by training the *same SIGMA model* on `train.csv` inside the notebook (same inputs, same forward pass, same loss function), then using the trained weights for inference. I also make the confidence output safe for the metric by enforcing a positive sigma and clipping to at least 70 (this aligns with the evaluation rule and avoids pathological negatives). Finally, I keep the submission row order identical to `sample_submission.csv` so predictions align perfectly.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.65932) has done: 'I fix the training-time shape mismatch by ensuring the training feature matrix has exactly the same 10 input columns (and order) that the SIGMA model expects, instead of accidentally creating an extra duplicated Weeks column via renaming. I also make the custom `score()` numerically safe during training by clipping `sigma` to at least 70 inside the loss (matching the competition’s metric clipping rule) to avoid NaNs/infs and improve convergence, without changing the model architecture or overall approach. Finally, I keep inference/submission logic the same but ensure the trained model is moved back to CPU for evaluation to avoid device mismatches, and always write a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns and row alignment.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.65361) has done: 'Your current training target uses `y_true = FVC` but your `score()` loss expects a 2D target where the first column is the true FVC; this mismatch makes optimization ineffective and keeps the score far from the target. I fix this by shaping `y_train` to `(N,1)` consistently and updating `score()/quartile_loss` to use `y_true[:, 0]` so the loss matches the competition metric math without changing the model or training loop structure. I also normalize the “baseline vs. prediction week” training rows to match your test-time pattern: for each patient, use the first (earliest-week) record as baseline features and all that patient’s weeks as targets (this is what your `csv_preprocess()` was intended to do, and it’s already in your codebase). Finally, I keep the same inference/submission logic and confidence clipping, ensuring the CSV stays aligned to `sample_submission.csv`.'
