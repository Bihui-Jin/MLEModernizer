# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 6. Current score

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.01221) has done: 'I fix the pipeline so it always produces a valid `submission.csv` end-to-end by (1) removing the hard dependency on a missing weight file and falling back safely to an available pretrained backbone when the `.pkl` isn’t present, and (2) fixing the CUDA/CPU dtype mismatch by ensuring the loaded state dict (if found) is moved to the same device as the model. I also correct the prediction loop to avoid creating an empty submission if any single image load fails (robust per-image exception handling) while keeping the core model and thresholding logic unchanged. These changes are necessary for correctness (no runtime errors, non-empty CSV) and should also improve score versus random/untrained inference by using ImageNet pretrained weights when competition weights are unavailable.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00484) has done: 'Your current score is far below the target, and the biggest issue is that the inference pipeline is effectively using an untrained head (and likely mismatched normalization) when the competition weights are missing, which makes predictions close to random. To move the score upward with minimal semantic change, I keep the same model and regression-to-class thresholding, but (1) ensure the EfficientNet backbone is always ImageNet-pretrained (even in the “no .pkl found” path) and (2) switch normalization to the standard ImageNet stats that match the pretrained backbone. These are small, directly relevant changes that should substantially increase QWK compared to the current near-random output, while preserving the overall approach and output format. The script still run end-to-end and write a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your current score (0.00484) is far below the target (0.9118), and the main reason is that the inference path is using the 5-way classifier head (ImageNet) rather than the DR-specific “final” regressor head that your thresholding expects, so predictions are effectively random. With minimal change to core logic, I (1) keep the exact same model/thresholding but call `net(img, final=True)` so we use the intended DR regression output, and (2) ensure weight loading (when present) doesn’t silently miss keys due to `module.` prefixes. These are directly relevant to metric alignment and should substantially increase QWK toward the target while keeping everything else (transforms, thresholds, architecture) intact. The script still run end-to-end and write a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your current 0.0 score is consistent with producing an invalid or degenerate submission (often all-one-class) rather than a model-quality issue, so the smallest high-impact fix is to ensure predictions are made in a numerically safe way and that the regressor-to-class conversion doesn’t silently break due to shape/device edge cases. I (1) make `regress2class` operate fully on-device with correct shapes (no `.data`, no CPU toggling inside), and (2) explicitly clamp the regressor output to `[0, 4.0]` before thresholding to avoid out-of-range effects that can collapse predictions. These changes keep the exact same model, weights logic, transforms, and thresholding semantics, but remove fragile tensor handling that can yield all-zeros/all-4s submissions and thus a near-zero QWK. The script still run end-to-end and write a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns and ordering.'
