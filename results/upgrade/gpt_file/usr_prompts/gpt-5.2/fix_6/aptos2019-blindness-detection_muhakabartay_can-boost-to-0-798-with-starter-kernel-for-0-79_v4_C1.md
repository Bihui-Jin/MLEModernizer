# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I remove the notebook magics and the `fastai` dependency (it’s not installed in your environment), while keeping the core idea intact: load an EfficientNet-B5 model, load provided weights, run inference on the test images, and write `submission.csv` with `id_code,diagnosis`. I also fix missing imports (`os`, `collections`, etc.), ensure the dataset paths match your provided `/kaggle/data/...` layout, and make sure the pretrained-weight download is not required (offline-safe). Finally, since no valid score was yielded, the main goal is to produce a valid end-to-end run and a correctly formatted submission CSV.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is coming from using random-initialized EfficientNet weights (no `abcdef.pth` exists), so predictions are essentially noise; the smallest legitimate fix is to load a real checkpoint that is already available offline in the competition dataset (typical kernels ship a `weights/` folder). I add an offline-safe search for common APTOS pretrained weight filenames/locations under `/kaggle/input/**` and load the first matching `.pth`/`.pt` found, while keeping the same model and inference pipeline. To avoid accidentally loading an incompatible checkpoint and silently staying near-random, I make the load stricter by requiring the final FC layer weights to match (or clearly fall back), and I also switch inference to `torch.no_grad()` to ensure consistent behavior. This should move the score up substantially toward your target without changing the core model or post-processing logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is consistent with effectively random predictions because the script almost certainly fails to load a compatible pretrained checkpoint (it builds `efficientnet-b5` with `num_classes=1`, which reject almost all common APTOS checkpoints trained for 5 classes). To move the score up toward your target with minimal change, I keep the same EfficientNet-B5 + inference pipeline, but switch the head to `num_classes=5` and use `argmax` to output class labels 0–4 directly (no threshold rounder needed for classification). I also tighten checkpoint loading to prefer checkpoints whose final layer matches 5 classes, which makes it much more likely we actually use real weights found under `/kaggle/input` offline. The output CSV format/path stays identical (`submission.csv` with `id_code,diagnosis`), and runtime remains within Kaggle limits.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is almost certainly because no compatible pretrained checkpoint is actually being loaded, so the EfficientNet-B5 runs with random weights and produces near-random labels. I keep the exact same model/inference approach, but tighten and broaden the offline checkpoint discovery to prioritize APTOS/EfficientNet-B5 5-class checkpoints under the provided dataset folder, and then enforce a *hard requirement* that the checkpoint contains a matching `_fc.weight` with 5 outputs (otherwise we stop instead of silently submitting noise). I also ensure the correct image size is taken from the model definition (456 for B5) to avoid accidental mismatch if you later swap variants, without changing preprocessing semantics. These minimal changes should move the score sharply upward toward your target while preserving the core pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I fix the failure in checkpoint discovery/loading so the pipeline can run end-to-end and write a valid `submission.csv`. The root issue is that this environment likely contains no compatible `.pth/.pt` weights (and Kaggle is offline), so hard-failing guarantees a 0.0 score via no submission; I add an offline-safe fallback that still produces a correct-format submission when no checkpoint exists. To move the score up toward your target with minimal semantic change, I also use the provided `train.csv` to compute class priors and, in the no-weights fallback case only, emit the constant majority-class prediction (a common baseline that beats random on this dataset) while keeping the EfficientNet inference path unchanged when weights are found. Finally, I make the data root auto-detect between `/kaggle/input/...` and `/kaggle/data/...` so the script runs reliably in standard Kaggle layouts.'
