# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I fix the runtime by making the device selection CPU-safe (use CUDA only if available) and wrapping inference in `torch.no_grad()` so it runs efficiently end-to-end in Kaggle without a GPU driver. I also make the model weight loading robust by checking alternative common `/kaggle/input/...` paths and using `map_location=device`, so missing/CPU environments don’t crash. Next, I ensure predictions are aligned and complete by sorting by `id_code` and merging on `id_code` instead of relying on `zip`, which can silently misalign. Finally, I always generate a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns, falling back to `sample_submission.csv` shape if any model file is unavailable so you still get a submit-ready CSV.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your current 0.0 score is most consistent with a submission/prediction alignment problem rather than model quality, because the script can silently drop rows by merging predictions with `how="inner"` (keeping only ids predicted by *all* available models) and then filling missing ids with 0, which heavily hurts QWK. I keep your exact model/inference logic, but change the ensemble merge to a `how="outer"` merge and then re-align to `test_df` so every test id gets a prediction even if one model is missing an image or fails on a subset. I also add a minimal, metric-relevant improvement: compute thresholds on the training labels’ empirical class distribution by mapping the regression output quantiles to classes (still ordinal discretization, no new training), which typically boosts QWK vs fixed cutoffs while keeping semantics the same. Finally, I ensure the submission is exactly 367 rows, in test order, with integer `diagnosis`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'Your 0.0 score is most consistent with producing essentially constant/invalid predictions (often caused here by missing model weights, wrong DATA_ROOT, or silently failing loads), so the smallest score-moving change is to guarantee real predictions even when external weight files aren’t present. I keep your exact architectures and inference flow, but (1) make DATA_ROOT resolve to an actually-existing input folder, (2) optionally use torchvision ImageNet weights as a fallback when your custom `.pth` files aren’t available (so outputs vary per image instead of all-zeros), and (3) fix the DenseNet transform to include the same normalization as the other models (a metric-relevant calibration fix, not a logic rewrite). The submission is still aligned to `test.csv` order and always written as `submission.csv` with 367 rows and integer `diagnosis`.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.10804) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime errors by removing the broken custom ImageNet-pretrain download paths (which cause `KeyError` and SSL download failures) and instead using torchvision’s built-in ImageNet weights only as a fallback when your custom `.pth` files aren’t found. I also correct the `pretrain` flag logic (it currently passes `False` instead of `None`/`"imagenet"`) so model construction is deterministic and doesn’t accidentally trigger unwanted pretrained-loading code. Finally, I keep your existing inference/ensemble/quantile-binning logic intact, but ensure every test id gets a prediction and a valid `submission.csv` is always written.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.23784) has done: 'Your current negative QWK is most consistent with predictions being effectively random with respect to the ordinal labels, which can happen here because you’re using ImageNet backbones with a randomly-initialized 1-unit regression head when the custom .pth weights are missing/not found. To move the score toward the target with minimal semantic change, I keep your exact models and inference flow, but make weight-path resolution search more robust in the actual `/kaggle/input` tree so the intended fine-tuned checkpoints are much more likely to be loaded. I also make state-dict loading tolerant to common key-prefix differences (`module.`, `model.`) and allow `strict=False` as a fallback only when shapes match, preventing silent all-random heads due to tiny naming mismatches. Finally, I keep your quantile-binning and submission alignment, but add a safe check to ensure we predict for every `id_code` in `test.csv` even if image listing misses any files.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.08661) has done: 'Your current score (0.23784) is far below the target (0.91845), so the most likely blocker is that the intended fine-tuned checkpoints are still not being loaded and you’re effectively predicting with ImageNet backbones + random 1-unit heads. I keep your exact model architectures and inference loop, but make checkpoint discovery more robust (search `/kaggle/input` for multiple common filename variants and also allow `.pt/.bin`), and make state-dict loading handle more real-world wrappers (nested `model_state_dict`, `ema_state_dict`, etc.) so the fine-tuned heads actually load. I also add a strict sanity check that warns if a head stays randomly initialized (by verifying the loaded keys include the final layer), because that directly correlates with low QWK. Finally, I preserve your quantile-binning and submission alignment, and still always write a valid `submission.csv`.'
