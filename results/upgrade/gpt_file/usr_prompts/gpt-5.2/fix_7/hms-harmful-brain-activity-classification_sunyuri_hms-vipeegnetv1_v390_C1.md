# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime crash by removing the unnecessary `torchaudio/torch` imports (they trigger a protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` incompatibility in this Kaggle image even when not used for your current `DATATYPE=['eeg']`). I also make the notebook robust in Kaggle “inference-only” mode by ensuring `train.csv` (the locally-saved preprocessed file) is not required when `NEEDTRAIN=False`, and by creating a safe fallback that builds a valid submission even if no model weights are found (uniform probabilities that sum to 1). Finally, I fix a batching/indexing bug in test-time slicing (`max(i-TEST_BATCHSIZE+1, len(preds_all))` is wrong) so predictions align 1:1 with `test.csv` ordering and produce a correct `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime crash (`MessageFactory.GetPrototype` protobuf issue) by avoiding the problematic matplotlib/protobuf interaction and by safely deferring plotting-related imports/usage so inference can run in the Kaggle image. I also fix two inference bugs that hurt score: (1) `TARGETS` should be taken from `sample_submission.csv` (not inferred from `train.csv` which may not be used in inference) and (2) the test `DataGenerator` currently feeds zeros (because it sets `r_eeg=0`), so I make it use the center 50s window for test EEGs. Finally, I ensure the written `submission.csv` rows align 1:1 with `test.csv` and probabilities are strictly normalized and clipped for valid KL-divergence scoring.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the immediate crash caused by the protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` incompatibility by pinning the pure-Python protobuf implementation before importing TensorFlow/Keras (this avoids the Kaggle image’s compiled-protobuf mismatch). I also make inference robust when `NEEDTRAIN=False` by not requiring `train.csv` at runtime and by providing the `TARGETS_RAW` columns only when training is enabled. Finally, I correct the test-mode EEG windowing in `DataGenerator` to use the true center of the 50s test EEG (rather than always starting at 0), which should materially reduce KL divergence toward your target without changing the model architecture/training semantics.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the protobuf/TensorFlow import crash by setting the environment variable early and (as a fallback) ensuring the pure-Python protobuf implementation is used before TensorFlow is imported. I also fix the `DataGenerator` test-mode EEG windowing so it uses the actual center of the 50s test EEG (not always starting at 0), which should materially reduce KL divergence while preserving the model and preprocessing logic. Finally, I make inference robust to missing weights by still producing a valid `submission.csv` with correct columns, normalized probabilities, and row alignment to `test.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation *before* any TensorFlow/Keras import, and I also add a safe fallback so inference still completes even if TensorFlow can’t be imported in this environment. To move the score down toward your target (lower is better), I fix a key inference mismatch: test EEGs should be windowed from the true center (50s), but the generator currently always starts at 0s for test; this change preserves the core model and preprocessing while improving alignment. Finally, I harden submission writing to guarantee correct column order, strict normalization (sum to 1), clipping for KL stability, and a `.csv` output. All changes are minimal and do not alter the architecture or training loop semantics.'
