# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the fare amount for a taxi ride given the pickup and dropoff locations.

## Metric
Root mean-squared error.

## Submission Format
For each `key` in the test set, you must predict a value for the `fare_amount` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
key,fare_amount
2015-01-27 13:08:24.0000002,11.00
2015-02-27 13:08:24.0000002,12.05
2015-03-27 13:08:24.0000002,11.23
2015-04-27 13:08:24.0000002,14.17
2015-05-27 13:08:24.0000002,15.12
etc
```

## Dataset
- **train.csv** - Input features and target `fare_amount` values for the training set (about 55M rows).
- **test.csv** - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict `fare_amount` for each row.
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format (columns `key` and `fare_amount`). This file 'predicts' `fare_amount` to be $`11.35` for all rows, which is the mean `fare_amount` from the training set.

### Data fields
**ID**

- **key** - Unique `string` identifying each row in both the training and test sets. Comprised of **pickup_datetime** plus a unique integer, but this doesn't matter, it should just be used as a unique ID field.Required in your submission CSV. Not necessarily needed in the training set, but could be useful to simulate a 'submission file' while doing cross-validation within the training set.

**Features**

- **pickup_datetime** - `timestamp` value indicating when the taxi ride started.
- **pickup_longitude** - `float` for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
- **pickup_latitude** - `float` for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
- **dropoff_longitude** - `float` for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
- **dropoff_latitude** - `float` for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
- **passenger_count** - `integer` indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.

**Target**

- **fare_amount** - `float` dollar amount of the cost of the taxi ride. This value is only in the training set; this is what you are predicting in the test set and it is required in your submission CSV.

- What this solution (achieved 15.27203) has done: 'I make the code compatible with the current Kaggle environment by (1) fixing the Keras 3 optimizer API usage and removing/guarding unsupported visualization imports, (2) replacing the URL-based NYC water mask with a local-only fallback so cleaning no longer crashes without internet, and (3) fixing datetime parsing and a couple of time-feature logic bugs that currently generate wrong indicators and hurt RMSE. I also ensure the train/test CSV paths match your provided `/kaggle/input/...` structure and that the submission file is written correctly as `key,fare_amount`. These changes keep the same overall model/feature approach but should materially improve score from the current 15.3 toward your ~4.4 target by preventing broken cleaning and correcting feature engineering.'
- What this solution (achieved 151.79366) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime error caused by Keras 3’s backend API change by implementing the RMSE metric using `tf_keras.backend` (which still provides `sqrt/mean/square`) so `model.fit()` runs. I also fix the input file paths to match your actual `/kaggle/input/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/...` location so data loading works in the Kaggle environment you described. Finally, I make the plotting cell conditional on `history` existing, so the notebook won’t crash if training fails for any other reason, and I ensure the submission CSV is written with the required `key,fare_amount` columns.'
- What this solution (achieved 351.92591) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime crash in the first import cell by avoiding the standalone `keras` package (which is triggering a protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` incompatibility in this environment) and consistently using `tf_keras` instead. This keeps the same Sequential/Dense/BatchNorm architecture, training loop, and loss, but makes imports/optimizer/loss calls stable under Python 3.7 on Kaggle. I also remove the inappropriate `"accuracy"` metric (it is for classification and can distort training/metrics logging for regression), keeping RMSE/MAE which align with the competition RMSE objective; this is a minimal change that should move score substantially toward the 4.41 target from 151.79. Finally, I ensure the submission is always written as a valid `key,fare_amount` CSV to the specified filename.'
- What this solution (achieved 6.43427) has done: 'I fix the immediate crash caused by the protobuf/Keras incompatibility by removing all `tf_keras` imports and switching to `tensorflow.keras` (which is stable on Kaggle for this competition) while keeping the exact same model architecture, loss, optimizer type, and training loop. I also correct the input data loading so the `key` column is preserved for the test set (needed for submission) and ensure the submission writer aligns predictions 1:1 with `test.csv` rows. Finally, I add a small safety clamp on predictions (non-negative fares) to prevent obviously invalid outputs that can explode RMSE, which should move the score substantially toward your 4.41 target without changing the core approach.'
- What this solution (achieved 8.93681) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/Keras import crash by avoiding the standalone Keras 3 stack entirely and using the `tf_keras` package that is installed in your environment, keeping the same model, optimizer type, loss, and training loop. I also fix the `mean_squared_error` API call in the debug MSE cell (it was removed in newer Keras) by computing MSE with NumPy/TensorFlow ops without changing training semantics. To nudge RMSE down toward your 4.41 target without changing the core approach, I apply the same `clean()` filtering to the held-out `test_df` before feature engineering so evaluation isn’t polluted by obviously invalid rows that the model never sees during training. The script still write a valid `key,fare_amount` submission CSV with the same filename.'
- What this solution (achieved 403.09104) has done: 'I fix the immediate runtime crash in the first cell caused by the protobuf/Keras incompatibility by removing the `tf_keras` stack and using `tensorflow.keras`, which is stable in this Kaggle environment. To move RMSE down toward your 4.41 target with minimal semantic change, I apply the same `clean()` step to the actual Kaggle test set (`testKaggle`) and then ensure the submission still contains all original test rows by predicting on the full test set and only using the cleaned-test predictions where available, filling the remaining rows with the median prediction (score-improving vs leaving them misaligned). I also make datetime feature extraction robust to parsing failures by dropping rows with unparseable datetimes during cleaning (train/val/internal test only) while keeping the original test keys intact. The model architecture, loss, optimizer type, and training loop remain unchanged.'
