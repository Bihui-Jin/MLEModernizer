# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

- What this solution (achieved -8.76216) has done: 'I fix the two runtime blockers preventing any submission: the protobuf/TensorFlow import crash and the pandas `DataFrame.append` removal (plus the cascade of undefined variables caused by that failure). I also make the Keras model compile cleanly on TF 2.18 by switching the deprecated optimizer args (`lr`, `decay`) to supported ones, without changing the model architecture or training loop semantics. Finally, I ensure we always write a valid `submission.csv` with exactly the required columns and that `Patient_Week` alignment remains correct by merging from `sample_submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -7.95288) has done: 'I fix the two runtime blockers: the protobuf/TensorFlow import crash (by removing the forced pure-python protobuf setting and making it conditional) and the training crash caused by a shape mismatch in the custom loss (by feeding `y` as a 2D array with the expected 3 columns, without changing the model). I keep the model, loss definitions, folds, epochs, and prediction logic the same, only adjusting the input/label shapes to match what the loss expects. Finally, I ensure the submission is always written as `submission.csv` with exactly `Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence`, keeping the same post-processing logic to avoid unintended score swings.'
- What this solution (achieved -7.95288) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf crash by pinning protobuf to the compatible pure‑python implementation before importing TensorFlow (this is the current runtime blocker). I also keep determinism stable by setting seeds after TensorFlow import as you already do, without touching the model/loss/training loop. Finally, I add a small safety clamp to ensure predicted Confidence is always positive and at least 70 at submission time (this matches the metric’s clipping behavior and typically nudges score upward without changing the core learning). The rest of the pipeline (features, model architecture, folds, epochs, and prediction logic) is preserved.'
- What this solution (achieved -7.95288) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf import crash that currently prevents the notebook from running by removing the forced pure‑python protobuf setting and instead trying a normal TensorFlow import first with a safe fallback. Then I keep the model, loss, folds, and training loop unchanged, but adjust only the final submission confidence handling: avoid setting baseline Confidence to `0.1` (which is effectively clipped to 70 by the metric anyway) and instead set it to `70` directly to better match evaluation and nudge the score upward without altering predictions. Finally, I keep the submission alignment exactly as required and ensure `submission.csv` is always written with the correct columns.'
- What this solution (achieved -7.95288) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash caused by protobuf 6.x incompatibility by setting `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` and forcing a clean TensorFlow import (this is the current runtime blocker). Then I keep the model/loss/training loop identical, but make the confidence post-processing consistent with the metric by always using the model’s predicted uncertainty for test rows and clipping it to at least 70 (this is a minimal calibration change that should improve the score toward your target). Finally, I ensure the submission is written as `submission.csv` with exactly `Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence` and correct alignment with `sample_submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.26937) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf import crash by making the protobuf “python” fallback conditional and robust, so the notebook can start reliably in this environment. Then I keep the model, loss, folds, epochs, and feature engineering identical, but correct the custom `score()` loss sign so it matches the competition metric (higher-is-better) rather than minimizing the negative of it; this is a minimal semantic bug fix that should improve score toward your target without changing the architecture or training loop. Finally, I harden the uncertainty post-processing by enforcing `Confidence = max(abs(pred_unc), 70)` and keep submission alignment exactly as in `sample_submission.csv`, writing a valid `submission.csv`.'
