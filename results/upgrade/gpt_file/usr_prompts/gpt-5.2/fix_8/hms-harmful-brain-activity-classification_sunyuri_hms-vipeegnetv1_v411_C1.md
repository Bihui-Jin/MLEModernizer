# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the runtime crash by removing the unused `keras_hub` import (it triggers the protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` error in this Kaggle environment) and by avoiding TensorFlow determinism calls that are not consistently supported across builds. I also make inference robust on Kaggle by ensuring `TARGETS` is loaded from `sample_submission.csv` (so it’s always defined even when `NEEDTRAIN=False`) and by providing a safe fallback when no model weights are found (uniform probabilities that still pass submission validation). Finally, I correct the test batch slicing bug that could produce empty/incorrect batches and ensure predictions are clipped/renormalized to sum to 1 for every row, producing a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation before importing TensorFlow (this is the common root cause in Kaggle for that exact error). I also ensure inference always defines `TARGETS` (even when `NEEDTRAIN=False`) by loading them from `sample_submission.csv` unconditionally, so the submission columns are always correct. Finally, I add a small safeguard so test-time filtering doesn’t reference undefined filter coefficients when `NEEDTRAIN=False`, while keeping the model/training logic unchanged and still writing a valid `submission.csv` with row-wise probabilities summing to 1.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf runtime *before any protobuf/TensorFlow import* and by avoiding TF determinism calls that can trigger this failure in Kaggle’s TF build. I also make the inference path robust and scoring-improving by loading the provided fold weights correctly (most public model datasets use `fold{i}_stage2.weights.h5`, not `fold{i}_stage2...` for i up to 99) and by ensuring we actually run model inference instead of falling back to uniform predictions (which is consistent with your current high KL score). Finally, I keep submission formatting strict: correct column names from `sample_submission.csv`, probabilities clipped and renormalized per row, and always write `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the protobuf/TensorFlow crash (`MessageFactory` has no `GetPrototype`) by forcing the pure-Python protobuf runtime early and (critically) disabling C++ protobuf via `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` and also preventing TensorFlow from importing the C++ implementation. Next, I ensure inference actually runs the model instead of accidentally falling back to uniform predictions by robustly locating weight files and compiling the cloned models before `predict()` (needed on some TF/Keras builds). Finally, I keep submission validity strict by clipping + renormalizing probabilities to sum to 1 and writing `submission.csv` with the exact sample submission columns/order.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation *before any TensorFlow/protobuf-related import* and by avoiding the determinism call that can trigger the same issue on Kaggle builds. Then I fix the uniform-submission fallback bug: the current merge logic explodes the row count and causes a length mismatch when assigning probabilities; I instead write the submission by directly aligning to `test.csv` order and enforcing the exact sample-submission columns. These changes are execution-unblocking and score-neutral (they just ensure the model can run and that a valid `submission.csv` is always produced). Finally, I also make the inference path load test EEGs directly (minimal, only when needed) so model inference can actually run on Kaggle without requiring an unavailable `/kaggle/input/preprocess/eegs.npy`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` crash by forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation *and* disabling the C++ protobuf backend before any TensorFlow/protobuf import happens. Then, because your current KL score (1.40995) indicates the script is likely falling back to uniform predictions on Kaggle (no weights found), I make the weight discovery more robust by also checking common weight locations under `/kaggle/input/` and by searching recursively for `fold*_stage*.weights.h5` files. Finally, I ensure inference has all required test inputs by loading EEG parquet files on-the-fly (since `spectrograms_test`/`stfts_test`/`imgs_test` are empty for `DATATYPE=["eeg"]`), and keep the submission strictly valid (correct columns, clipped and row-normalized probabilities).'
