# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

- What this solution (achieved -24.65417) has done: 'I fix the pandas `.append()` deprecation by switching to `pd.concat`, which unblocks preprocessing. Then I fix the missing pretrained weight file by adding an automatic fallback: if the `.pth` file is not present, the script train the same model on the tabular features only (feeding a zero-image tensor so the architecture stays unchanged) and then run inference to generate a valid submission. I also make file paths robust for Kaggle (`/kaggle/input/...`) while keeping the original logic, and ensure `test` is defined so the later post-processing cells run. Finally, I clamp `Confidence` to be at least 70 and write `submission.csv` with the required columns.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.65417) has done: 'I fix the CUDA out-of-memory error in the fallback training path by avoiding allocating and training on full 3D image tensors when weights are missing; instead, the same Combined_NET be trained with the IMAGE branch kept in eval mode and fed a single shared zero-image batch (so the architecture and loss stay the same but memory stays bounded). I also make the training/inference device selection robust (use CUDA if available, otherwise CPU) and ensure all tensors/models are moved consistently. Finally, I keep the submission-writing logic unchanged but ensure `Confidence` is clipped to at least 70 and the output CSV is always produced.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.97134) has done: 'I fix the CUDA out-of-memory in the fallback training path by ensuring the IMAGE branch is never executed during fallback (it’s currently still being run, which creates huge 3D activations even if parameters are frozen). This is done by overriding the model’s `image.forward` to return a constant zero embedding of the correct shape, preserving the overall Combined_NET/SIGMA architecture and loss semantics while keeping memory bounded. I also make `make_eval_data` use the same safe image-embedding bypass when weights are missing, so inference doesn’t waste time/memory reading and running 3D CTs in the fallback mode. Finally, I keep submission formatting identical but ensure `Confidence` is numeric and clipped to at least 70 before writing `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.65418) has done: 'I fix the fallback training path shape bug by ensuring the model always receives 42 tabular features (as SIGMA expects) rather than the raw 10 features, which currently triggers the matmul size mismatch. I also ensure `BYPASS_IMAGE` is always defined (even if training fails early) so the inference cell can run deterministically. Finally, I keep the existing evaluation/post-processing logic intact, but make sure `test` is created and a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns is always written.'
