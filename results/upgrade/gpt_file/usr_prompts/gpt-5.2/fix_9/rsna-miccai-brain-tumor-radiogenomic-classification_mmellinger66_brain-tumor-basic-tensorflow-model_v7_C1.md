# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the two blocking runtime issues first: the TensorFlow import crash caused by an incompatible `protobuf` version, and the `pydicom.read_file` API removal (use `pydicom.dcmread`). Then I make the training/inference path run end-to-end by ensuring the model checkpoint path is valid in TF/Keras 2.18 (use `.keras`), and by aligning predictions with the ROC-AUC metric (use class-1 probability rather than `argmax`, and remove rounding that destroys calibration). Finally, I keep your core data-loading and CNN architecture intact while making the output submission match the sample format and ordering exactly, writing `submission.csv` in the working directory.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'The immediate blocker is the TensorFlow import crash caused by an incompatible `protobuf` version in this environment; the only safe fix is to force protobuf’s pure-Python implementation before *any* TensorFlow/protobuf-related imports, and if needed pin the python implementation more explicitly. After that, the rest of your pipeline should run, but I also make sure the DICOM reader uses `pydicom.dcmread` (already correct) and that the submission IDs are consistently zero-padded to match the sample submission merge (avoids silent NaNs that would hurt AUC). These changes are runtime/stability and alignment fixes and should keep your core modeling/training logic intact while nudging score upward by preventing ID-mismatch dilution. The script write a valid `submission.csv` in the working directory.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash by pinning protobuf to the Python implementation *and* applying the compatibility shim for TF/TFP that avoids the `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` failure in this Kaggle image. Then I make the DICOM path sorting robust (some filenames may not follow the assumed pattern), which prevents occasional empty/failed loads that silently degrade training/inference. Finally, I keep your model/training/prediction logic unchanged and ensure the submission IDs/predictions align exactly to the sample submission and always write a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the blocking TensorFlow/protobuf crash by applying a safe compatibility shim that works whether `MessageFactory` is a class or an instance in this environment (the current code assumes it’s always a class, causing the `GetPrototype` AttributeError). I keep your data loading, model, and training logic unchanged, only adjusting the shim placement to run before importing TensorFlow. Finally, I keep the submission creation as-is but add a small guard to ensure predictions are finite and clipped to [0,1] (score-neutral/stability) and always write `submission.csv` in the working directory.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash by replacing the brittle protobuf `MessageFactory` shim (which triggers the exact `GetPrototype` AttributeError you’re seeing) with a no-op-safe guard and rely on forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation before importing TensorFlow. Then I make ID handling consistent by normalizing `BraTS21ID` to integers right after reading CSVs (and only zero-padding when writing/merging for submission), which prevents silent merge issues. Finally, I keep your model/training/prediction logic unchanged and ensure the pipeline always writes a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns and ordering.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash (`'MessageFactory' object has no attribute 'GetPrototype'`) by forcing protobuf to use the pure-Python implementation and applying a safe, version-agnostic shim for `google.protobuf.message_factory.MessageFactory.GetPrototype` *before* importing TensorFlow. This is a runtime-only fix and does not change your data pipeline, model architecture, or training loop semantics. I also add a small fallback to set `KAGGLE_WORKING_DIR`-safe paths and keep the submission writing unchanged so it always produces `submission.csv` with the required columns/order. Everything else (DICOM loading, slice selection, model, training epochs, prediction averaging) is kept intact to preserve score behavior while unblocking execution.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow/protobuf import crash by removing the brittle `MessageFactory.GetPrototype` monkeypatch that triggers the `AttributeError` in this environment and relying only on forcing the pure-Python protobuf implementation before importing TensorFlow. I keep your data loading, model definitions, training loop, and prediction logic unchanged, only making the import sequence robust so the notebook runs end-to-end. I also ensure deterministic seeds are set after TensorFlow successfully imports (same seeds as you already use), and keep the submission writing exactly in the required format as `submission.csv` in the working directory.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import crash (`MessageFactory` has no `GetPrototype`) by forcing protobuf’s pure-Python implementation *and* patching protobuf’s `MessageFactory` to provide a compatible `GetPrototype` method before importing TensorFlow (this is purely a runtime-compatibility fix). I also ensure seeding happens after TensorFlow is successfully imported so the script runs deterministically without triggering the crash earlier. The rest of your pipeline (DICOM loading, slice selection, model definition, training loop, and probability-based submission creation) is kept unchanged to preserve the current scoring behavior while making the notebook run end-to-end and reliably write `submission.csv`. Finally, I add a small safety guard so the checkpoint always exists (fallback to the in-memory model if needed), preventing submission-generation failures.'
