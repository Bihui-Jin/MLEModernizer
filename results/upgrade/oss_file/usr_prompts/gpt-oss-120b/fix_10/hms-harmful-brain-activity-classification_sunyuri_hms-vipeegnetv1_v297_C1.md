# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'Implemented a robust fallback that catches any failure during model loading or inference (e.g., protobuf incompatibility) and safely creates a valid submission using class prior probabilities. This ensures the script always produces a correctly‑formatted `submission.csv` without crashing, while preserving the original logic when models load successfully.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'I added a safe‑check for TensorFlow functionality right after the import. If any TensorFlow operation (like creating a constant or converting the weight arrays) fails, the script now switches to the fallback path that builds a prior‑based submission and exits, preventing the uncaught `MessageFactory` protobuf error. This keeps the original logic intact while guaranteeing a valid `submission.csv` is always produced.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'Implemented a robust TensorFlow safety wrapper that catches any failure during TF setup (imports, configuration, mixed‑precision, EfficientNet import, etc.). If any step errors, the script now immediately switches to the fallback path that creates a prior‑based submission and exits, preventing crashes from protobuf incompatibilities or other TF‑related issues. The fallback logic is placed before any TF‑dependent code (model building or inference), ensuring a valid `submission.csv` is always produced.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'The fix adds a safe, broader TensorFlow setup guard that falls back to the prior‑based submission if any TensorFlow‑related error (including protobuf issues) occurs, and it normalizes the model predictions so every row sums to 1, preventing inflated KL‑divergence scores. This keeps the original architecture while guaranteeing a valid, properly‑calibrated CSV output and moves the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.68479) has done: 'Implemented a patient‑specific fallback predictor: when TensorFlow cannot be used, the script now computes per‑patient class probability distributions from the training data and applies them to the test set (falling back to the overall class prior when a patient is unseen). This change keeps the original logic intact, ensures a valid `submission.csv` is always written, and yields more informed probabilities that move the KL‑divergence score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'Implemented a streamlined fallback predictor that uses only the overall class prior probabilities (which are guaranteed to sum to 1) instead of the per‑patient priors that were degrading the KL‑divergence score. This change removes the buggy patient‑specific lookup, guarantees proper normalization, and keeps the rest of the pipeline untouched. Both the early‑exit fallback (when TensorFlow cannot be loaded) and the inference‑failure fallback now employ this simpler, more reliable prior‑based submission.'
