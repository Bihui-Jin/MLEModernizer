# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -9.09786) has done: 'The fixes address three critical failures: (1) prevent the protobuf‑related TensorFlow import error by safely handling optional TensorFlow imports, (2) replace the broken TensorFlow‑based `QuantileRegressorMLP` with a simple, reliable `SimpleRegressor` that uses GradientBoosting, and (3) generate the submission directly from this new model without relying on missing prediction columns.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.68573) has done: 'Implemented a modest boost to the regression model for better predictive performance while keeping the core workflow intact.  
Key changes:
- upgraded `GradientBoostingRegressor` with more trees (`n_estimators=300`) and limited depth to improve fit.
- retained the same confidence calculation, ensuring it respects the required minimum of 70.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.8398) has done: 'I added the raw `Weeks` column to the feature set and made the regression model a bit stronger (more trees and deeper depth).  The confidence is now based on the median absolute residual (still respecting the required minimum of 70), which gives a tighter estimate without changing the overall workflow.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.78384) has done: 'The fix adds the required imports, defines a global seed and a simple `seed_everything` helper, and reorganizes the notebook cells so that all variables are defined before they are used. No core modeling logic is changed; the script now runs end‑to‑end and writes a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.78384) has done: 'I lower the predicted confidence to the minimal allowed value (70 ml) because the competition metric penalizes larger confidence values. By fixing the confidence to 70 ml instead of using the median absolute residual (which can be higher), the score should move closer to the target without altering the core model or data processing.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.95466) has done: 'I keep the existing GradientBoosting model and its minimal confidence of 70 ml, but add a lightweight LinearRegression model and blend its predictions with the GBM output (70 % GBM + 30 % linear). This small ensemble often improves forecast accuracy without altering the core architecture, and the confidence stays at the optimal minimum, moving the score closer to the target.'
