# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -9.30752) has done: 'The fix removes the TensorFlow import error, corrects the deprecated `normalize` argument in `LinearRegression`, and replaces the complex model training with a simple baseline prediction (using the baseline FVC and a constant confidence). This ensures the pipeline runs without errors and produces a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.30752) has done: 'I fix the TensorFlow import error by simplifying its import handling and replace the naïve constant‑baseline predictions with a lightweight per‑patient linear regression (slope + intercept) built from the training data. This keeps the core logic unchanged while improving the FVC forecasts and giving a reasonable confidence estimate, moving the score closer to the target. The script now run end‑to‑end and write a correct `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.30752) has done: 'I remove the unnecessary heavy imports that cause protobuf / tensorflow related errors and wrap the optional imports in safe try/except blocks. This keeps the core logic unchanged while ensuring the script runs without import failures and still produces a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.04559) has done: 'We train a simple GradientBoostingRegressor on the pre‑processed training data and use it to predict FVC for the test set, while keeping a global confidence based on the training residuals (clipped at 70). This replaces the per‑patient linear baseline and should raise the validation metric toward the target without altering the overall pipeline logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.29282) has done: 'I remove the problematic TensorFlow import that caused the early crash and add a simple per‑patient linear‑trend feature (`LinearPred`) that was already being computed in the preprocessing step. I also tighten the GradientBoostingRegressor by increasing the number of trees and adjusting learning‑rate/subsample, which should modestly improve the validation score while keeping the core logic unchanged. The script now runs end‑to‑end and writes a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.64017) has done: 'I improve the model by adding a simple interaction feature (Weeks × Age) and by using a per‑patient confidence estimate (standard deviation of residuals) instead of a single global confidence. Both changes keep the original pipeline intact while expected to raise the Laplace Log Likelihood toward the target score. I also increase the number of GradientBoosting trees slightly for a modest boost in predictive power.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.64017) has done: 'The update simplifies the confidence estimation by fixing it to the minimum allowed value (70 ml) for every prediction, which improves the Laplace Log Likelihood since a smaller σ _clipped  yields a higher (less negative) score. The rest of the pipeline, including feature engineering and the GradientBoostingRegressor model, remains unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.54379) has done: 'I add a simple quadratic feature (`Weeks_sq`) to give the model a bit more flexibility and increase the number of GradientBoosting trees (to 1000) with a slightly smaller learning rate. These minimal changes keep the core pipeline unchanged while giving the regressor a chance to fit the data better, which should raise the Laplace Log Likelihood toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.54379) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged and only improve the confidence estimation, which directly influences the Laplace Log Likelihood. Instead of a constant 70 ml, the script now uses the per‑patient residual standard deviation (or the global residual std when unavailable) and clips it at 70 ml, giving a more realistic σ that reduces the penalty term. This small change is expected to raise the score toward the target while preserving all core logic.'
