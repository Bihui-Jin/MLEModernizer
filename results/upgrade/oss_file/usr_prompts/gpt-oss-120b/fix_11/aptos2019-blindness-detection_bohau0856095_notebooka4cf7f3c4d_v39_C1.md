# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.05084) has done: 'I updated the script to handle missing GPU devices and absent weight files gracefully, switched the EfficientNet backbone to use pretrained ImageNet weights (which improves predictions without external weight files), added safe loading of optional checkpoints, and ensured the test image paths and submission CSV creation work correctly. These fixes allow the notebook to run end‑to‑end and output a non‑empty ``submission.csv`` while keeping the original model architecture and logic intact.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.2594) has done: 'I switch the inference to use the model’s classifier logits (which predict the five DR grades directly) instead of the regressor‑based thresholds. By taking the arg‑max of the classifier output we obtain a more appropriate class prediction, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target score while keeping the rest of the pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.0129) has done: 'The fix addresses the runtime error caused by squeezing the regression output to a scalar, which broke the `regress2class` function. By squeezing only the last dimension, the tensor retains a batch dimension, allowing the conversion to class predictions. This change restores the inference loop, ensures predictions are generated, and produces a non‑empty submission CSV. No core model logic is altered, keeping the original architecture intact.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.00547) has done: 'I adjust the inference step to rely on the classifier’s soft‑max probabilities instead of averaging it with the noisy regression output. By computing the expected class from the classifier logits and rounding it, we keep the core model unchanged while producing predictions that better match the evaluation metric, which should move the score toward the target. The rest of the pipeline stays the same.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.03954) has done: 'I fixed the runtime error in the inference loop by preserving the batch dimension when converting the regression output to class probabilities. Instead of using `r_out.squeeze()` (which removes all dimensions and can produce a scalar), the code now uses `r_out.squeeze(0)` so that `regress2class_prob` receives a 1‑D tensor with a batch size of 1. This prevents the `IndexError` and enables the script to generate a non‑empty submission file.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.06924) has done: 'I adjust the inference step to rely solely on the classifier’s soft‑max probabilities instead of averaging them with the regression‑based probabilities. This change keeps the model architecture untouched, removes the noisy regression contribution, and is expected to raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target score. The rest of the pipeline (data loading, transforms, checkpoint handling, and CSV output) remains unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.07272) has done: 'I modify the inference step to combine the classifier’s expected value with the regression output, averaging them before rounding to a class. This keeps the model architecture unchanged while leveraging both prediction heads, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target score. The rest of the script remains the same, ensuring a valid submission.csv is still produced.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.13903) has done: 'I adjust the inference step to rely on the classifier’s soft‑max probabilities directly, taking the arg‑max as the final prediction instead of averaging with the regression output. This keeps the model architecture unchanged while using the head that is most appropriate for the discrete 0‑4 classes, which should move the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score significantly closer to the target.'
