# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf.

## Metric
Categorization accuracy.

## Submission Format
```
image_id,label
1000471002.jpg,4
1000840542.jpg,4
etc.
```

## Dataset
**[train/test]_images** the image files.

**train.csv**

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the ID code for the disease.

**sample_submission.csv** A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the predicted ID code for the disease.

**[train/test]_tfrecords** the image files in tfrecord format.

**label_num_to_disease_map.json** The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

# 2. Python version

2.7

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.61099) has done: 'I remove the TensorFlow import (which crashes in this environment) and replace the Keras image generator with a lightweight custom generator that only stores filenames. I also compute the most common label from the training set and use it for every test image, ensuring the prediction list matches the filenames length and the submission CSV is correctly written. This fixes the import error and the mismatched array lengths while keeping the original workflow structure.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.61099) has done: 'The fix casts the training labels to strings so Keras `flow_from_dataframe` accepts them when `class_mode="categorical"`; this removes the TypeError and lets the pipeline run end‑to‑end, producing a correctly‑formatted `submission.csv`. No other logic is altered, preserving the original model and workflow.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.61173) has done: 'We fix the TensorFlow training call by removing unsupported `workers` and `use_multiprocessing` arguments, which caused the crash and prevented the submission file from being created. This minimal change lets the model train correctly, produces predictions, and ensures `test_filenames` is defined so the final CSV is written.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.36921) has done: 'I added the missing imports and data‑loading steps, defined the train and test image directories, and enhanced the feature extractor to use a flattened 32×32 RGB pixel vector (instead of only channel means). This gives the linear model many more informative features, improving its predictive power while keeping the original training loop unchanged. The script now creates a proper `submission.csv` with the required columns.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.18423) has done: 'The update replaces the iterative gradient‑descent training with a simple class‑mean (nearest‑centroid) classifier, which works better with the raw 32×32 RGB pixel features while keeping the overall linear‑model structure. By computing the average feature vector for each disease class and assigning each test image to the nearest class mean, the prediction accuracy is expected to increase substantially, moving the score closer to the target. The rest of the pipeline (feature extraction, CSV creation) remains unchanged.'
