# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.07859) has done: 'I fix the missing pretrained weights and the device‑type mismatch by loading the EfficientNet backbone with pretrained weights (instead of a missing local checkpoint) and adding a safe fallback when the checkpoint file isn’t found. This ensures the model runs on the same device as the input images and produces a non‑empty submission CSV.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.02467) has done: 'I replace the custom head‑only EfficientNet (which was never trained) with a fully pretrained EfficientNet‑B4 classifier when the custom weight file is missing, and adjust the inference loop to take the arg‑max of its 5‑class logits. This uses the existing pretrained ImageNet weights, requires no extra training, and should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target without altering the overall pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.09547) has done: 'I keep the overall model and data pipeline unchanged but improve the inference step: use both defined image transforms for test‑time augmentation, average the logits, and convert the averaged probabilities to an expected class value (rounded to the nearest integer). This modest change often yields predictions that better align with the quadratic weighted kappa metric, moving the score toward the target without altering the core architecture or training logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.09957) has done: 'I add a simple class‑frequency prior to the logits (so the model’s predictions are nudged toward the observed label distribution) and replace the expected‑value rounding with a straightforward arg‑max vote. This keeps the backbone unchanged, adds only a lightweight calibration step, and uses a bit more test‑time augmentation, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target without altering the core architecture.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.06581) has done: 'I adjust the inference step to reduce the heavy prior‑logit shift and use a calibrated probability average with a small class‑frequency blend. Instead of adding large log‑priors to the raw logits, I (1) compute softmax probabilities for each augmentation, (2) average them, (3) blend a tiny amount (α = 0.1) of the empirical class distribution, and (4) predict the expected rating by rounding the weighted class index. This small calibration is expected to move the quadratic weighted kappa upward toward the target while keeping the original model and pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.07453) has done: 'I keep the overall model and augmentation pipeline unchanged, but simplify the prediction step to use a direct arg‑max over the averaged softmax probabilities and turn off the class‑prior blending (α = 0). This removes unnecessary calibration that was diluting the raw model scores, and the arg‑max decision is more aligned with the categorical nature of the task, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05357) has done: 'I keep the same model and data pipeline but modify the inference step to use an expected‑value prediction (probability‑weighted class) instead of a simple arg‑max, and re‑introduce a small amount of class‑prior blending (α ≈ 0.1). This aligns the predicted scores more closely with the quadratic weighted‑kappa metric while preserving the core architecture and training logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.10455) has done: 'I replace the expected‑value + prior blending step with a direct argmax of the averaged softmax probabilities (no blending). This keeps the model and augmentations unchanged while producing sharper class decisions, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0493) has done: 'I keep the overall model and data pipeline unchanged but modify the prediction step to use the probability‑weighted expected class value (rounded to the nearest integer) instead of a raw arg‑max. This aligns the output more closely with the quadratic weighted kappa metric and is expected to raise the score toward the target while preserving the core architecture.'
