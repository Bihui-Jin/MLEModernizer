# Goal

Make the code finish within a 600-second timeout. The last attempt timed out after 10 minutes. Optimize for speed WITHOUT harming result accuracy and WITHOUT changing the core logic.

# Requirements

- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (timeout fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Keep file paths unchanged.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Provided with images of chemicals, predict the corresponding International Chemical Identifier (InChI) text string of the image.

## Metric
Mean [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between the InChi strings you submit and the ground truth InChi values.

## Submission Format
For each `image_id` in the test set, you must predict the InChi string of the molecule in the corresponding image. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_id,InChI
00000d2a601c,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
00001f7fc849,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
000037687605,InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - the training images, arranged in a 3-level folder structure by `image_id`
- **test/** - the test images, arranged in the same folder structure as `train/`
- **train_labels.csv** - ground truth InChi labels for the training images
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
