# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I fixed the script so it always produces a valid submission CSV. The changes add a safe fallback when no pretrained model files are found (using uniform probabilities that sum to 1 per row) and ensure the model is loaded onto the correct device. This removes the `ValueError` caused by an empty predictions list and guarantees a correctly‑shaped DataFrame for export.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.39779) has done: 'I add a small preprocessing step that computes the overall class‑vote distribution from the training set and use this empirically‑derived prior as the fallback prediction when no pretrained model files are found. This prior is more informative than a uniform guess and should reduce the KL‑divergence toward the target score, while keeping the original pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I fixed the two runtime errors that stopped the notebook from generating a submission. In the training‑prior computation I replaced the invalid `fillna` call with a column‑wise fill using a Series derived from the class prior, so `PATIENT_PRIOR_DICT` is correctly created. In the inference loop I made the data generator iterable by calling it (or adding `__iter__`), and then iterated over the batches properly. These changes let the code run end‑to‑end, produce a normalized probability matrix, and write a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.89478) has done: 'I blend the model‑averaged predictions with the overall class prior (using a modest weight) before normalising. This regularises overly confident predictions, moving the KL‑divergence lower toward the target score while preserving the existing pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I reduced the model‑weight and blended the predictions with a per‑patient prior (falling back to the global class prior when a patient‑specific prior is unavailable). This gives a higher‑entropy, more calibrated output, which is expected to lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score while keeping the original pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I lower the weight of the model predictions to zero so the submission relies solely on the per‑patient (or global) class priors, which are higher‑entropy and expected to reduce the KL‑divergence toward the target 0.428 (lower is better). This change is minimal and keeps the overall pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I increase the model‑weight from 0 to a modest value (e.g., 0.2) so that available pretrained model predictions are blended with the per‑patient (or global) priors. This small change keeps the original pipeline intact while adding informative signal that should lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I reduce the influence of the (potentially noisy) model predictions by setting the blending factor `alpha` to 0, so the final submission relies only on the per‑patient (or global) class priors. This minimal change keeps the overall pipeline unchanged while moving the KL‑divergence score closer to the lower‑is‑better target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'The current submission only uses patient‑ or global‑class priors ( α = 0 ), which yields a KL ≈ 1.68. Blending the available model predictions with the priors reduces the divergence (previous experiments showed α≈0.2 gives ≈0.89). Therefore we increase the blending factor to 0.3 so the model’s signal contributes more while still keeping the prior regularisation and the final normalisation step.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.67825) has done: 'I increase the blending factor `alpha` so that the model’s predictions contribute more weight (while still regularising with the patient‑wise priors). This modest change keeps the core pipeline untouched but should lower the KL‑divergence, moving the score from 1.678 closer to the target 0.428.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.89478) has done: 'I lower the model‑weight `alpha` to a modest value (0.3) so the blended predictions benefit from any pretrained model while still relying on the patient priors, and then apply a small additional smoothing with the overall class prior (`beta = 0.5`). This extra regularisation raises the entropy of the output probabilities, which empirically lowers the KL‑divergence and moves the score closer to the target 0.428, without altering the core data‑handling or model code.'
