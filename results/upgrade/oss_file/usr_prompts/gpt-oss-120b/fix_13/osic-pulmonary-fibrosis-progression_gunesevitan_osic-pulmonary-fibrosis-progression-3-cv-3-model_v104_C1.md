# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -18.99663) has done: 'We replace the failing TensorFlow imports with a safe fallback, skip the complex neural‑network training, and generate a minimal viable prediction (using the baseline FVC and a fixed confidence). This resolves the protobuf error, eliminates the ValueError when constructing the Keras Input layer, and ensures a proper `submission.csv` is written with the required columns.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.22515) has done: 'I fix the feature‑column mismatch that caused KeyErrors and ensure the prediction columns exist before building the submission. The change only adjusts how the feature list is built (using the intersection of train and test columns) and leaves the rest of the pipeline untouched, so the core model logic and evaluation remain unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.06844) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged and only adjust the GradientBoostingRegressor hyper‑parameters to give the model a bit more capacity, which should reduce prediction error and move the score closer to the target. The change is confined to cell 4 and retains all other logic and file handling.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.12458) has done: 'I make the imports robust by guarding optional libraries (including TensorFlow) against import errors, and I strengthen the GradientBoostingRegressor (more trees and deeper depth) to improve predictive performance and move the score closer to the target while keeping the core logic unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.58741) has done: 'I add a simple non‑linear feature (`Weeks_Passed_Sq`) to give the GradientBoostingRegressor a bit more expressive power and set the confidence to the minimum allowed value (70) which is often closer to the optimal confidence for the Laplace Log Likelihood. These small changes keep the original pipeline intact while nudging the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.16335) has done: 'Implemented two key fixes:  
1. Bypassed the problematic TensorFlow import by initializing the related symbols to None, eliminating the protobuf‑related crash.  
2. Enhanced the GradientBoostingRegressor (more trees and deeper depth) and raised the prediction confidence to 100 ml, which aligns better with the Laplace Log Likelihood metric and moves the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.24847) has done: 'Implemented two targeted tweaks to move the validation score closer to the target while preserving the original pipeline:

1. **Model capacity boost** – increased `n_estimators` to 2500 and `max_depth` to 6 for a slightly more expressive GradientBoostingRegressor, which can capture additional patterns without altering the core algorithm.
2. **Confidence alignment** – set the predicted `Confidence` to 150 ml (a higher constant) to better match typical error magnitudes, reducing the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood penalty.  

These changes are minimal, keep all existing preprocessing and feature engineering intact, and ensure the script still writes a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.79063) has done: 'Implemented a dynamic confidence estimate to better align with the Laplace Log Likelihood metric. After fitting the GradientBoostingRegressor, the script now computes the training MAE and uses the larger of this error or the minimum allowed 70 ml as the constant confidence for all predictions. This modest change keeps the original model and preprocessing untouched while moving the score upward toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.76744) has done: 'Implemented two minimal enhancements to bring the validation score closer to the target:

1. Added interaction features (`Weeks_Passed_Percent` and `Weeks_Passed_Age`) during tabular preprocessing, giving the model extra useful signals while keeping the original pipeline intact. These features are also included in scaling when enabled.
2. Adjusted the constant confidence calculation to `max(70, mae * 1.1)`, providing a slightly larger confidence that better matches the typical error magnitude for the Laplace Log Likelihood metric.

These targeted tweaks preserve the core logic and should improve the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.96085) has done: 'I add a modest non‑linear feature (`Weeks_Passed_Cu`) to give the GradientBoostingRegressor a bit more expressive power and raise the constant confidence factor from 1.1 × MAE to 1.5 × MAE, which better matches the Laplace Log Likelihood trade‑off. These adjustments keep the core pipeline unchanged while nudging the validation score upward toward the target.'
