# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -10.81761) has done: 'I fixed the pandas `.append` removal, replaced the missing pretrained model with a simple baseline predictor (using the provided baseline FVC and a confidence of 70), and kept the rest of the pipeline unchanged so a valid `submission.csv` is produced.'
- What this solution (achieved -24.79812) has done: 'I added a lightweight global trend correction: using the training set I compute the average per‑week change in FVC and adjust each test prediction by `base_FVC + slope * (Week‑base_Weeks)`. This keeps the original simple baseline model but adds a modest, data‑driven improvement expected to raise the Laplace Log Likelihood score toward the target while leaving all other logic untouched.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.81761) has done: 'I remove the ineffective global‑slope correction and simply predict each patient’s FVC as the baseline measurement, keeping the confidence at the minimum allowed value 70. This restores the baseline predictor that achieved a much better score (‑10.8) and moves the metric toward the target ‑6.93 while preserving the rest of the pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.81761) has done: 'I fixed the merge that created `baseline_fvc` (the original merge used a non‑existent column `base_Weeks`), rewrote the baseline‑week/FVC extraction using explicit joins, and kept the later slope‑adjusted prediction logic unchanged. This resolves the `KeyError` and subsequent `NameError`s, allowing the pipeline to run fully and write a proper `submission.csv` with the required columns.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.81761) has done: 'I dampen the per‑patient slope contribution when predicting future FVC values. By multiplying the learned average slope by a factor 0.5, the model makes more conservative adjustments from the baseline measurement, which should reduce large prediction errors and move the Laplace Log Likelihood score closer to the target ‑6.93 while keeping all other logic unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.30752) has done: 'I raise the slope contribution from the patient‑wise average trend (changing the dampening factor from 0.5 to 0.7) and set a slightly larger default confidence of 100 ml (still respecting the required minimum of 70). These minimal tweaks should bring the predictions closer to true values and reduce the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood penalty, moving the score toward the target while keeping the overall pipeline unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.1155) has done: 'I adjust the slope contribution and the fallback for missing patient‑specific slopes. In cell 7 I replace the hard‑coded 0.0 default with the overall average slope from the training data, and I increase the slope_factor from 0.7 to 0.85 (a modest boost). This keeps the original baseline‑plus‑trend model while making predictions slightly closer to true values, which should raise the Laplace Log Likelihood toward the target score. The rest of the pipeline and the submission format stay unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.97472) has done: 'I lowered the slope contribution and set the default confidence to the minimum allowed (70 ml) so predictions stay closer to the baseline and are less penalized by an inflated confidence value. These tiny adjustments keep the original pipeline intact while moving the Laplace Log‑Likelihood score upward toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.16559) has done: 'I increase the trend‑adjustment factor to use a slightly larger slope (0.90) and raise the default confidence from the minimum 70 ml to a modest 100 ml. This should bring the predictions closer to the true values while providing a more realistic uncertainty, moving the Laplace Log‑Likelihood score upward toward the target without altering the core modelling pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.11472) has done: 'I lower the slope‑adjustment factor from 0.90 to 0.85 and set the default confidence to the minimum allowed 70 instead of 100. This makes the predictions stay closer to the baseline (reducing large errors) and avoids the extra penalty from an inflated confidence, which should raise the Laplace Log‑Likelihood score toward the target while keeping the rest of the pipeline unchanged.'
