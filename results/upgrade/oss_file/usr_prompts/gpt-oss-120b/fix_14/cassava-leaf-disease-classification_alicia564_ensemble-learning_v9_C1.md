# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf.

## Metric
Categorization accuracy.

## Submission Format
```
image_id,label
1000471002.jpg,4
1000840542.jpg,4
etc.
```

## Dataset
**[train/test]_images** the image files.

**train.csv**

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the ID code for the disease.

**sample_submission.csv** A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the predicted ID code for the disease.

**[train/test]_tfrecords** the image files in tfrecord format.

**label_num_to_disease_map.json** The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

# 2. Python version

3.13

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.45179) has done: 'The update adds a quick GPU availability check before trying to train the EfficientNet model. When no GPU is detected (common in the execution environment), it raises an exception that immediately activates the lightweight fallback logistic‑regression pipeline, avoiding the costly TensorFlow training loop. This change preserves all original logic—if a GPU is present the full model still trains, otherwise the fallback runs exactly as before—so results remain identical while staying well under the 600‑second limit.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05531) has done: 'The patch adds a safeguard when converting predicted disease names back to the original label IDs. If a disease name is missing from the mapping (which caused the previous `KeyError: nan`), the code now defaults to a fallback label (here chosen as the most common label “0”). This ensures a valid submission CSV is always generated without interrupting the pipeline. The core model logic remains unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05531) has done: 'I increase the image resolution used for feature extraction from 32×32 to 64×64 so the RandomForest receives richer visual information, and I boost the forest’s capacity slightly (more trees and balanced class weighting) to better capture the patterns. These adjustments keep the overall pipeline, model type, and label handling unchanged while providing a modest expected gain in accuracy, moving the score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05531) has done: 'I train the RandomForest on the full training set (instead of the 80 % split) and enrich the image features: resize images to 96×96, flatten the RGB array, and concatenate per‑channel mean and standard‑deviation. This adds useful global colour statistics without changing the overall model type. The forest size is modestly increased to 500 trees to capture the richer feature space, keeping the same preprocessing logic and submission format, which should raise the accuracy toward the target.'
