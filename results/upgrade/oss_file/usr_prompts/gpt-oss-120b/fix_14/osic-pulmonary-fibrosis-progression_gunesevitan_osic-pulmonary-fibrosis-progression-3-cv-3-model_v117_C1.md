# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -9.21396) has done: 'I fixed the feature‑mismatch that caused the GradientBoosting model to fail on the test set and ensured the prediction columns are added to `df_test` so the submission pipeline can locate them. The changes only drop the fold identifier columns from the training features (they are not useful for prediction) and keep the same feature list for the test set, preserving the original logic and model.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.03755) has done: 'I increase the GradientBoostingRegressor capacity by adding more trees and a smaller learning rate, which should give slightly better FVC predictions and move the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score closer to the target. No other logic is changed.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.43193) has done: 'I enable feature scaling in the tabular preprocessing and replace the constant confidence with a data‑driven estimate based on training residuals (using the residuals’ magnitude, clipped at 70). For the test set I use the median of those residual‑based confidences, which keeps the pipeline consistent while likely improving the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.79858) has done: 'I make the feature list only include numeric columns so the GradientBoostingRegressor receives only numbers (removing the stray string “Male” that caused the fit error). I also keep the existing prediction‑column naming, so the submission pipeline can find the MLP columns and output a proper CSV file. This change fixes the runtime errors and enables a valid submission, moving the score toward the target without altering the core modeling logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.96535) has done: 'I add a lightweight residual‑prediction model so each test sample gets its own confidence value instead of a single median, and I fix the column‑ordering bug in the submission pipeline (remove the alphabetical sort that swaps FVC and confidence). These minimal changes keep the original GradientBoostingRegressor core while providing more accurate confidence estimates and correctly mapping predictions, which should raise the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.03369) has done: 'I turn on one‑hot encoding for the categorical columns so the GradientBoosting model receives richer features, and I boost the model capacity by increasing the number of trees while using a smaller learning rate (both for the main FVC predictor and the residual‑confidence predictor). These changes are small, keep the original workflow intact, and are expected to raise the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.37758) has done: 'I replace the test‑set confidence prediction with a single constant confidence derived from the median training residual (clipped at 70). This reduces noisy confidence estimates and should raise the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target while keeping the core model unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.03369) has done: 'I replace the constant median confidence used for test predictions with per‑sample confidence estimates from the residual‑prediction GradientBoosting model, clipping them at the required minimum of 70. This keeps the core model unchanged while providing more realistic confidence values, which should raise the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target.'
