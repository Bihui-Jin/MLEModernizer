# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

- What this solution (achieved -20.23859) has done: 'I fixed the column‑name mix‑up that caused the KeyError, removed the unused model‑evaluation steps that relied on those missing columns, and directly filled the submission using the baseline FVC from the test set with a constant confidence of 70. This restores a runnable pipeline and produces a valid `submission.csv` ready for Kaggle.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I replace the simplistic baseline‑only filling with a lightweight per‑patient linear‑trend predictor: for each patient in the training set I fit a straight line (Weeks → FVC) using the available records, then use that line to predict the three required future weeks.  Confidence is set to the larger of the model’s residual‑based std‑dev and the required minimum 70, so it stays valid for the competition metric while giving a more realistic uncertainty.  This modest modelling change keeps the original architecture untouched but should raise the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I add a small global bias correction to the linear‑trend predictions: after fitting per‑patient slopes I compute the average residual on the training records and add this bias to every future prediction. This modest adjustment keeps the original model untouched while nudging the predictions toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I keep the per‑patient linear trend model but add a tiny global week‑based residual correction, which nudges predictions toward the average training error as a function of week. This simple adjustment should raise the validation score toward the target without altering the core modeling approach. I also trim the output to the exact three required columns before writing the CSV.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I increase the confidence (σ) values used in the submission because a larger σ slightly reduces the penalty term in the competition metric, moving the score upward toward the target. The change only adjusts how confidence is computed, preserving the existing linear‑trend predictions and overall logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12767) has done: 'I increase the confidence values used for the submission by scaling the previously computed σ upwards (e.g., *1.2*). A larger σ reduces the Δ/σ penalty while the ln term grows more slowly, which typically raises the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score and moves the result closer to the target without altering the core prediction logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.27376) has done: 'I increase the confidence scaling factor (CONF_SCALE) from 1.20 to 2.00. Larger confidence values (σ) lower the Δ/σ penalty term in the Laplace Log‑Likelihood while only mildly increasing the ln term, which should raise the score toward the target without altering the model’s core linear‑trend logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I lower the confidence scaling factor back to 1.0 (no artificial inflation). The original model already respects the minimum 70 ml confidence, so removing the extra CONF_SCALE should reduce the penalising ln term of the Laplace Log‑Likelihood and move the score upward toward the target while keeping all other logic unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.12772) has done: 'I increase the confidence values used for each prediction by returning the overall training‑set standard deviation (subject to the required minimum of 70 ml) instead of the per‑patient residual‑based estimate. This raises σ, which reduces the Δ/σ penalty in the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood while only slightly increasing the log‑σ term, moving the score upward toward the target without altering the core linear‑trend predictions.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.38748) has done: 'I increase the confidence scaling factor, which raises the σ values used in the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood. Larger σ reduces the Δ/σ penalty for most points while only modestly increasing the ln term, moving the score upward toward the target. The core modeling logic (per‑patient linear trend, global/week bias) remains unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.69335) has done: 'I increase the confidence scaling factor to give the model a larger σ (which reduces the Δ/σ penalty in the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood) and remove the global and week‑bias corrections so the predictions rely only on the per‑patient linear trend. These minimal adjustments keep the core linear‑trend logic intact while moving the score upward toward the target.'
