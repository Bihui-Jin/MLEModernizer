# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

- What this solution (achieved 1.41937) has done: 'I replace the missing model imports with dummy stand‑ins, skip loading any external checkpoints, and compute a simple global class‑probability distribution from the training votes. `gen_ensemble_pred` now return this distribution for every test row, guaranteeing a valid probability vector that sums to 1. The submission dataframe is built by stacking the prediction list correctly, fixing the shape error.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.68479) has done: 'Implemented missing imports, corrected undefined names, and ensured the pipeline runs end‑to‑end. Added standard library and package imports (os, math, typing, numpy, pandas, polars, torch, torch.nn, scipy), fixed cell ordering, and restored data loading. The model fallback remains unchanged, and the prediction logic now uses patient‑specific or global vote distributions, normalising each row so probabilities sum to 1. Finally, the script writes a correctly formatted `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.31003) has done: 'I smooth the patient‑specific vote distributions with the overall global distribution proportionally to how many training votes a patient contributes. This reduces extreme probabilities (which hurt KL) while still keeping patient information, and guarantees every class has a non‑zero probability so the submission remains valid and moves the score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.32838) has done: 'I reduce the influence of patient‑specific vote distributions, which were causing over‑confident predictions and a high KL score, by shrinking the blending weight for each patient and applying a mild temperature smoothing to the final probabilities. This keeps the overall logic unchanged while moving the validation score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.28419) has done: 'I modestly improve the probability blending: add per‑eeg vote distributions (when available) and make the patient‑specific weighting a bit softer, then apply a slightly stronger temperature smoothing (power 0.85). These changes keep the overall pipeline unchanged while giving the model more personalised information and smoother predictions, which should lower the KL score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.3186) has done: 'I reduce the influence of patient‑specific vote distributions (so predictions are less over‑confident) and apply a mild flattening temperature scaling (power > 1) before renormalising. These small tweaks keep the overall pipeline unchanged while moving the KL score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.31804) has done: 'I increase the temperature‑flattening exponent (making predictions more uniform) by introducing a `TEMP_POWER` constant and using it in the probability scaling step. This small change keeps the overall blending logic unchanged while likely lowering the KL divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.21078) has done: 'I slightly reduce the temperature‑flattening exponent (from 1.5 to 0.9) to make the blended probabilities less overly uniform, and adjust the patient‑weighting formula to give a bit more influence to patient‑specific vote distributions (using a square‑root‑based weighting). These minimal tweaks keep the core logic unchanged while aiming to lower the KL score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.33365) has done: 'I reduce the influence of patient‑specific vote distributions (by using a linear weight = cnt/(cnt+max_cnt) instead of the previous sqrt weighting) and apply a slightly stronger temperature flattening (power = 0.8). These minimal adjustments keep the original blending logic while moving the predictions toward a smoother distribution, which should lower the KL divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.17046) has done: 'I tighten the blending by giving patient‑specific vote distributions more influence (using a sqrt‑based weight) and make the temperature scaling slightly sharpening (power > 1). Both tweaks keep the overall pipeline unchanged but move the predictions away from the overly‑uniform baseline, which should lower the KL score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.3399) has done: 'I lower the temperature exponent to make predictions smoother and replace the sqrt‑based patient weighting with a simple linear blend, which reduces over‑confident patient‑specific probabilities and should lower the KL divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.31501) has done: 'I slightly increase the temperature exponent to make predictions less overly uniform (TEMP_POWER = 0.9) and give patient‑specific vote distributions more influence by redefining the patient blending weight as a simple linear ratio = count / max_count (capped at 1). These minimal tweaks keep the overall pipeline unchanged while producing smoother, more personalized probability vectors, which should lower the KL score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.23372) has done: 'I increased the influence of patient‑specific vote distributions by scaling the patient weight up to twice its original linear value (capped at 1) and switched the temperature exponent from 0.9 to 1.1 so predictions are slightly sharper rather than overly uniform. These minimal changes keep the overall blending logic unchanged while improving calibration, which should lower the KL divergence toward the target score.'
