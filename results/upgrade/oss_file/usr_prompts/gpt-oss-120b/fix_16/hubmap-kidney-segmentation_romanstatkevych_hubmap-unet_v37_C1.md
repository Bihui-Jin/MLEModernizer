# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect functional tissue units (FTUs) across different tissue preparation pipelines. An FTU is defined as a "three-dimensional block of cells centered around a capillary, such that each cell in this block is within diffusion distance from any other cell in the same block".

## Metric
Dice coefficient.

## Submission Format
Use run-length encoding on the pixel values. Submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the mask should be binary, meaning the masks for all objects in an image are joined into a single large mask. A value of 0 should indicate pixels that are not masked, and a value of 1 will indicate pixels that are masked.

The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
img,pixels\
1,1 1 5 1\
2,1 1\
3,1 1\
etc.
```

## Dataset
The training set includes annotations in both RLE-encoded and unencoded (JSON) forms. The annotations denote segmentations of glomeruli.

Both the training and public test sets also include anatomical structure segmentations. They are intended to help you identify the various parts of the tissue.

### File structure
The JSON files are structured as follows, with each feature having:

-   A `type` (`Feature`) and object type `id` (`PathAnnotationObject`). Note that these fields are the same between all files and do not offer signal.
-   A `geometry` containing a `Polygon` with `coordinates` for the feature's enclosing volume
-   Additional `properties`, including the name and color of the feature in the image.
-   The `IsLocked` field is the same across file types (locked for glomerulus, unlocked for anatomical structure) and is not signal-bearing.

Note that the objects themselves do NOT have unique IDs. The expected prediction for a given image is an RLE-encoded mask containing ALL objects in the image. The mask, as mentioned in the Evaluation page, should be binary when encoded - with `0` indicating the lack of a masked pixel, and `1` indicating a masked pixel.

`train.csv` contains the unique IDs for each image, as well as an RLE-encoded representation of the mask for the objects in the image.

`HuBMAP-20-dataset_information.csv` contains additional information (including anonymized patient data) about each image.

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.01967) has done: 'I adjust the image‑loading logic to handle the very large TIFF files that caused the DecompressionBombError and OpenCV size assertion. The fix sets a higher Pillow pixel limit and tries a stronger down‑sampling flag (IMREAD_REDUCED_COLOR_8) before falling back to other methods. These changes keep the original model and workflow intact while allowing the script to run end‑to‑end and produce a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01157) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged and only adjust the post‑processing threshold when converting the model’s output to a binary mask. Using the per‑image mean as a threshold is too adaptive and often yields overly sparse or overly dense masks, which hurts the Dice score. Setting a constant threshold of 0 (paired with the existing normalization) provides a more stable binary decision and is expected to move the validation Dice from 0.019 toward the target 0.856 without altering the model architecture or training logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.02697) has done: 'I keep the overall architecture and data handling unchanged, but replace the constant threshold with a high‑percentile (95 th) per‑image threshold so the binary mask becomes much sparser and better matches the true glomerulus regions. This small change is expected to raise the Dice score toward the target without altering the core model or training logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01157) has done: 'I lowered the per‑image threshold used to binarize the model’s output from a high 95 th percentile to a constant 0.0. This makes the predicted masks larger and moves the Dice score upward toward the target without changing the model architecture or training logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00752) has done: 'I keep the same lightweight model and data handling while fixing two key issues that hurt the score: (1) the checkpoint loader now accepts a full model object or a plain state‑dict, so pretrained weights are actually used when available; (2) the binary mask threshold is raised to a fixed 0.5 instead of 0.0, which better separates foreground from background for the existing model. These minimal tweaks keep the core logic unchanged but enable a much higher Dice score, moving it toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01157) has done: 'I lower the binary‑mask threshold from 0.5 to 0.0 so that more pixels are classified as foreground. This simple change typically raises recall and moves the Dice score upward toward the target without altering the model architecture or training flow.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01157) has done: 'I make two minimal tweaks that keep the original workflow intact but should raise the Dice score toward the target. First, I relax the tile‑skipping rule so that a patch is only ignored if it is both very dark **and** has very low saturation (changing the logical ‘or’ to ‘and’). This lets the model predict on more image regions. Second, I apply a sigmoid to the model’s raw averaged output and use a fixed 0.5 threshold when binarising, which aligns the post‑processing with the binary nature of the Dice metric. These small changes do not alter the model architecture or training loop, yet they provide more sensible predictions and move the score closer to the target.'
