# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 2. Python version

3.8

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 5. Target score

0.9113283087580588

# 6. Current score

0.0

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I fixed the missing imports, removed the unavailable fastai dependencies, and replaced the complex model pipeline with a simple baseline that uses the training label distribution to generate predictions. This ensures the script runs end‑to‑end, creates a correctly formatted `submission.csv`, and keeps the core logic minimal while still applying the existing `OptimizedRounder` for threshold calibration.'
