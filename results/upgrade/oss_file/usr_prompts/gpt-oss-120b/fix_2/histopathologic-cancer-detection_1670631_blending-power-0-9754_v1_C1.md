# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given a dataset of images from digital pathology scans, predict if the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. 

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability that center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,label
0b2ea2a822ad23fdb1b5dd26653da899fbd2c0d5,0
95596b92e5066c5c52466c90b69ff089b39f2737,0
248e6738860e2ebcf6258cdc1f32f299e0c76914,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
Files are named with an image `id`. The `train_labels.csv` file provides the ground truth for the images in the `train` folder. You are predicting the labels for the images in the `test` folder.

# 5. Target score

0.959618650404741

# 6. Current score

0.5

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'The fix changes the loading paths to point to the existing sample submission file (instead of the missing blend files), adds a safe fallback, and ensures the DataFrame is written out as a proper `sub.csv`. No core modeling logic is altered – we simply produce a valid submission file.'
