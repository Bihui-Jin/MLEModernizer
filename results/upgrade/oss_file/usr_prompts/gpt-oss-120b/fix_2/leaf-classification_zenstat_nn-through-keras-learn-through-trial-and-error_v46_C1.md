# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Use binary leaf images and extracted features to identify the species of plant.

## Metric
Multi-class log loss. 

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission Format
You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of leaf specimens which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. 

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. 

For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

### File descriptions
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **images/** - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields
- **id** - an anonymous id unique to an image
- **margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- **shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- **texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature

# 2. Python version

3.5

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 5. Target score

0.01388

# 6. Current score

0.04045

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.04045) has done: 'I fixed all import errors, updated deprecated Keras arguments, corrected variable names, and ensured the script builds a neural network, trains it, generates probability predictions for the test set, and writes a properly‑formatted CSV submission containing the required `id` column and one column per species.'
