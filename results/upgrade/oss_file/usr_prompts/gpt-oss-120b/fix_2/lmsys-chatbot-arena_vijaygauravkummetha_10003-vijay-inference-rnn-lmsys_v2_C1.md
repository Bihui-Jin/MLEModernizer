# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict which chatbot response a user will prefer in a competition between two chatbots.

## Metric
Log loss with "eps=auto"

## Submission Format
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for each target class. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
 id,winner_model_a,winner_model_b,winner_tie
 136060,0.33,0,33,0.33
 211333,0.33,0,33,0.33
 1233961,0.33,0,33,0.33
 etc
```

## Dataset
**train.csv**

- `id` - A unique identifier for the row.
- `model_[a/b]` - The identity of model_[a/b]. Included in train.csv but not test.csv.
- `prompt` - The prompt that was given as an input (to both models).
- `response_[a/b]` - The response from model_[a/b] to the given prompt.
- `winner_model_[a/b/tie]` - Binary columns marking the judge's selection. The ground truth target column.

**test.csv**

- `id`
- `prompt`
- `response_[a/b]`

**sample_submission.csv** A submission file in the correct format.

- `id`
- `winner_model_[a/b/tie]` - This is what is predicted from the test set.

# 6. Current score

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Lower is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 1.09861) has done: 'I fixed the missing and incorrect file paths, removed references to undefined variables (train data, k‑fold column, vocab, and model loading), and replaced the failing prediction logic with a safe fallback that assigns uniform probabilities (1/3 for each class). This ensures the script runs end‑to‑end, creates the required columns, and writes a valid `submission.csv` file, satisfying the competition’s submission format.'
