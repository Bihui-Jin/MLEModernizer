# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect apple diseases from images.

## Metric
Mean column-wise ROC AUC.

## Submission Format
For each image_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_id,
test_0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
test_1,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
test_2,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
etc.
```

## Dataset
Given a photo of an apple leaf, can you accurately assess its health? This competition will challenge you to distinguish between leaves which are healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease.

**train.csv**

- `image_id`: the foreign key
- combinations: one of the target labels
- healthy: one of the target labels
- rust: one of the target labels
- scab: one of the target labels

**images**

A folder containing the train and test images, in jpg format.

**test.csv**

- `image_id`: the foreign key

**sample_submission.csv**

- `image_id`: the foreign key
- combinations: one of the target labels
- healthy: one of the target labels
- rust: one of the target labels
- scab: one of the target labels
