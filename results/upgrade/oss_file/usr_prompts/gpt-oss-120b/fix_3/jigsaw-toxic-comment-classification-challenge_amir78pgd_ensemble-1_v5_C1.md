# Goal

Make the code finish within a 600-second timeout. The last attempt timed out after 10 minutes. Optimize for speed WITHOUT harming result accuracy and WITHOUT changing the core logic.

# Requirements

- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (timeout fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Keep file paths unchanged.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given a dataset of comments from Wikipedia's talk page edits, predict the probability of each comment being toxic.

## Metric
Mean column-wise ROC AUC; the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the six possible types of comment toxicity (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate). The columns must be in the same order as shown below. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,toxic,severe_toxic,obscene,threat,insult,identity_hate
00001cee341fdb12,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
0000247867823ef7,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset 
- **train.csv** - the training set, contains comments with their binary labels
- **test.csv** - the test set, you must predict the toxicity probabilities for these comments.
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
