# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -9.30752) has done: 'The fix removes the faulty TensorFlow imports and missing model loading, replaces the model‑based inference with a simple baseline that predicts each patient’s known baseline FVC for every week and assigns a constant confidence. This guarantees the script runs end‑to‑end, writes a valid `submission.csv`, and keeps the original feature engineering untouched. Minimal changes are made while preserving the overall data‑processing pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved -8.33643) has done: 'The fix removes the problematic TensorFlow import, adds a lightweight estimate of the average FVC change per week from the training data, and uses this slope to adjust the baseline FVC predictions for each future week. This keeps the original pipeline while providing a more realistic forecast and yields a higher score, still writing a proper `submission.csv`.'
