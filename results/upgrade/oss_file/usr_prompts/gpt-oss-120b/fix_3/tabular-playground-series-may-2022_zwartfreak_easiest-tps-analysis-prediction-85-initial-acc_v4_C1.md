# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given simulated manufacturing control data, predict whether the machine is in state `0` or state `1`.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `target` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,target
900000,0.65
900001,0.97
900002,0.02
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train.csv** - the training data, which includes normalized continuous data and categorical data
- **test.csv** - the test set; your task is to predict binary `target` variable which represents the state of a manufacturing process
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 5. Target score

0.8307

# 6. Current score

0.92981

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.92981) has done: 'The fix removes the faulty normalization that caused shape mismatches and eliminates the scaled model that broke binary‑classification requirements. We now train a single CatBoost classifier on the original features (excluding id and target) and generate predictions directly on the test set, producing a proper `submission.csv` with the required `id` and `target` columns.'
