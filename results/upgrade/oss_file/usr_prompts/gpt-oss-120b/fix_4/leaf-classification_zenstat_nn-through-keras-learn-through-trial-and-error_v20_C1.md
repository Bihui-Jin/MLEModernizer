# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Use binary leaf images and extracted features to identify the species of plant.

## Metric
Multi-class log loss. 

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission Format
You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of leaf specimens which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. 

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. 

For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

### File descriptions
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **images/** - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields
- **id** - an anonymous id unique to an image
- **margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- **shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- **texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature

- What this solution (achieved 4.60508) has done: 'I fixed the import errors, updated the Keras Dense layer arguments to the current API, replaced the deprecated `nb_epoch` with `epochs`, used `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`, ensured the label encoder and one‑hot conversion are defined, applied the same scaler to train and test data, generated predictions with `model.predict`, aligned the prediction columns with the sample‑submission file, and finally wrote a proper CSV containing the required `id` column and one probability column per class.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.2018) has done: 'The fix replaces the old Keras import with TensorFlow‑Keras to avoid the import error, changes the validation split to 20 % so each class can appear in the stratified test set, and trains the network longer (200 epochs) with a ReLU hidden layer to improve learning while keeping the original model structure. The rest of the pipeline (scaling, label encoding, prediction ordering, and CSV output) remains unchanged, ensuring a valid submission file is produced.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05899) has done: 'I fixed the import error by switching to the standalone Keras API (compatible with the installed TensorFlow Keras backend) and tweaked the neural network slightly—larger hidden layer, added dropout, and switched to the Adam optimizer with more training epochs—to improve the model’s learning while keeping the overall architecture unchanged. The script now runs end‑to‑end and writes a correctly‑formatted submission CSV.'
