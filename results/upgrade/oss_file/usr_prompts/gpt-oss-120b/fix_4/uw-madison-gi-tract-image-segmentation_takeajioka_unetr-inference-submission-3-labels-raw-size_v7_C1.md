# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a model to automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans.

## Metric
Mean Dice coefficient and 3D Hausdorff distance. 

The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by:

$$
\frac{2 \cdot |X \cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|}
$$

where $X$ is the predicted set of pixels and $Y$ is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 0 when both $X$ and $Y$ are empty. 

Hausdorff distance is a method for calculating the distance between segmentation objects A and B, by calculating the furthest point on object A from the nearest point on object B. For 3D Hausdorff, we construct 3D volumes by combining each 2D segmentation with slice depth as the Z coordinate and then find the Hausdorff distance between them. (Here the slice depth for all scans is set to 1). The expected / predicted pixel locations are normalized by image size to create a bounded 0-1 score.

The two metrics are combined, with a weight of 0.4 for the Dice metric and 0.6 for the Hausdorff distance.

## Submission Format
Use run-length encoding on the pixel values.  Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the mask should be binary, meaning the masks for all objects in an image are joined into a single large mask. A value of 0 should indicate pixels that are not masked, and a value of 1 will indicate pixels that are masked.

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,class,predicted
1,large_bowel,1 1 5 1
1,small_bowel,1 1
1,stomach,1 1
2,large_bowel,1 5 2 17
etc.
```

## Dataset
Each case is represented by multiple sets of scan slices (each set is identified by the day the scan took place). Some cases are split by time (early days are in train, later days are in test) while some cases are split by case - the entirety of the case is in train or test. The goal is to be able to generalize to both partially and wholly unseen cases.

### Files
- train.csv - IDs and masks for all training objects.
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- train - a folder of case/day folders, each containing slice images for a particular case on a given day.

Note that the image filenames include 4 numbers (ex. 276_276_1.63_1.63.png). These four numbers are slice width / height (integers in pixels) and width/height pixel spacing (floating points in mm). The first two defines the resolution of the slide. The last two record the physical size of each pixel.

Physical pixel thickness in superior-inferior direction is 3mm.

### Columns
- `id` - unique identifier for object
- `class` - the predicted class for the object
- `segmentation` - RLE-encoded pixels for the identified object

- What this solution (achieved 0.01781) has done: 'The fix removes the dependency on the unavailable **monai** package and replaces it with a lightweight NumPy‑based inference that thresholds each volume to create binary masks for the three classes. The script now correctly builds the test‑set dataframe, loads the generated NIfTI volumes, produces simple segmentations, encodes them with RLE, and writes a proper `submission.csv` file. This restores end‑to‑end execution and yields a valid submission while keeping the original workflow intact.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.11263) has done: 'I added a lightweight Otsu‑based thresholding step to replace the crude mean‑based binarisation, which gives a more realistic binary mask for each volume while keeping the overall pipeline unchanged. The new `otsu_threshold` function computes an optimal intensity cut‑off for each 3‑D scan, and the prediction loop now uses this threshold to build the three class masks before RLE encoding. All other logic, file handling and submission formatting remain identical, ensuring a valid `submission.csv` is produced and moving the score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.06964) has done: 'I improve the segmentation step by applying Otsu thresholding slice‑by‑slice instead of on the whole 3‑D volume, which yields a more realistic binary mask and should raise the Dice/Hausdorff score toward the target while keeping the rest of the pipeline unchanged.'
