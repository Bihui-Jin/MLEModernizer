# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf.

## Metric
Categorization accuracy.

## Submission Format
```
image_id,label
1000471002.jpg,4
1000840542.jpg,4
etc.
```

## Dataset
**[train/test]_images** the image files.

**train.csv**

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the ID code for the disease.

**sample_submission.csv** A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the predicted ID code for the disease.

**[train/test]_tfrecords** the image files in tfrecord format.

**label_num_to_disease_map.json** The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

# 2. Python version

3.13

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.61099) has done: 'I replaced the failing imports and removed references to unavailable model files. The script now reads the training labels, finds the most frequent class, and assigns that label to every test image to create a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.65508) has done: 'I replace the constant‑label baseline with a tiny TensorFlow CNN that learns from the training images, then use it to predict labels for the test set. The added model is lightweight (few layers, short training) so it runs quickly, and the rest of the workflow (reading CSVs, building the submission file) stays the same, moving the accuracy closer to the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.57324) has done: 'I set the protobuf implementation environment variable before importing TensorFlow to stop the `MessageFactory` error, and increase the training epochs slightly to boost accuracy while keeping the overall pipeline unchanged. The rest of the code stays the same, ensuring a valid `submission.csv` is written.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.51158) has done: 'I replace the failing TensorFlow pipeline with a lightweight, pure‑Python image classifier that uses Pillow to resize images and scikit‑learn’s LogisticRegression for training. This eliminates the protobuf import error, keeps the overall workflow (loading CSVs, building a submission file) unchanged, and should raise the validation accuracy from ~0.57 toward the target while still producing a valid `submission.csv`.'
