# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -11.34483) has done: 'I fixed the import error caused by TensorFlow, removed the missing‑pickle load, corrected the deprecated `np.int` usage, replaced the unsupported model loading with a simple scikit‑learn regressor trained on the provided training CSV, and rewrote the prediction loop to generate FVC and a constant confidence. The script now runs end‑to‑end and writes a valid `submission.csv` matching the required format.'
- What this solution (achieved -11.34483) has done: 'The changes fix the training feature mismatch by removing the non‑existent `Base_FVC` column from the training set and aligning the test features to the same list, which resolves the KeyError and subsequent NameErrors. The script now runs end‑to‑end, creates predictions with the RandomForest model, assigns a constant confidence, and writes a valid `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved -11.33249) has done: 'I add the baseline FVC (“Base_FVC”) and the target week (“Min_week”) as features for the RandomForest model, filling missing baselines with the median value. I also increase the tree depth slightly (to 15) to let the model capture more detail. These minimal feature enhancements should bring the validation score closer to the target while keeping the original workflow intact.'
