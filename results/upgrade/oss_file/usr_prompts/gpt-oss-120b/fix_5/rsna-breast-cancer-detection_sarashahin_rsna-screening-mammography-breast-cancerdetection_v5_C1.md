# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect breast cancer in mammograms.

## Metric
[Probabilistic F1 score](https://aclanthology.org/2020.eval4nlp-1.9.pdf) (pF1). This extension of the traditional F score accepts probabilities instead of binary classifications. 

With pX as the probabilistic version of X:

$$
pF_1 = 2 \frac{pPrecision \cdot pRecall}{pPrecision + pRecall}
$$

where:

$$
pPrecision = \frac{pTP}{pTP + pFP}
$$

$$
pRecall = \frac{pTP}{TP + FN}
$$

## Submission Format
For each `prediction_id`, you should predict the likelihood of cancer in the corresponding `cancer` column. The submission file should have the following format:

```
prediction_id,cancer
0-L,0
0-R,0.5
0-R,0.5
1-L,1
...
# Dataset

**[train/test]_images/[patient_id]/[image_id].dcm** The mammograms, in dicom format. You can expect roughly 8,000 patients in the hidden test set. There are usually but not always 4 images per patient. Note that many of the images use the jpeg 2000 format which may you may need special libraries to load.

**sample_submission.csv** A valid sample submission.

**[train/test].csv** Metadata for each patient and image. Only the first few rows of the test set are available for download.

- `site_id` - ID code for the source hospital.
- `patient_id` - ID code for the patient.
- `image_id` - ID code for the image.
- `laterality` - Whether the image is of the left or right breast.
- `view` - The orientation of the image. The default for a screening exam is to capture two views per breast.
- `age` - The patient's age in years.
- `implant` - Whether or not the patient had breast implants. Site 1 only provides breast implant information at the patient level, not at the breast level.
- `density` - A rating for how dense the breast tissue is, with A being the least dense and D being the most dense. Extremely dense tissue can make diagnosis more difficult. Only provided for train.
- `machine_id` - An ID code for the imaging device.
- `cancer` - Whether or not the breast was positive for malignant cancer. The target value. Only provided for train.
- `biopsy` - Whether or not a follow-up biopsy was performed on the breast. Only provided for train.
- `invasive` - If the breast is positive for cancer, whether or not the cancer proved to be invasive. Only provided for train.
- `BIRADS` - 0 if the breast required follow-up, 1 if the breast was rated as negative for cancer, and 2 if the breast was rated as normal. Only provided for train.
- `prediction_id` - The ID for the matching submission row. Multiple images will share the same prediction ID. Test only.
- `difficult_negative_case` - True if the case was unusually difficult. Only provided for train.

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.03121) has done: 'Implemented fixes to handle missing values, ensure the model trains correctly, and generate a valid `submission.csv`. Added NaN filling after one‑hot encoding, kept the original feature set, and corrected the prediction/submission flow so the script runs end‑to‑end and produces a submission file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.04374) has done: 'The adjustments apply a modest probability‑scaling factor (α = 0.6) to shrink model confidence, which reliably lowers the probabilistic F1 score toward the target 0.02 without altering the core model or feature set. The scaling is applied consistently to validation predictions (for metric reporting) and to test predictions (used in the final submission). No other logic is changed, so the script still runs end‑to‑end and produces a correct `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.04515) has done: 'I lower the probability‑scaling factor (α) from 0.6 to 0.3 so that the model’s confidence is further pulled toward 0.5, which reduces the probabilistic F1 score and moves it closer to the target of 0.02. The change is applied consistently to both validation and test predictions, preserving all other logic and ensuring a valid submission CSV is still produced.'
