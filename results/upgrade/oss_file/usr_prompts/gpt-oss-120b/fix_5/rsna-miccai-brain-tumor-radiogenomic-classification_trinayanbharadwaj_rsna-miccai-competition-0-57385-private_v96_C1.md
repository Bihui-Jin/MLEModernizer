# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `BraTS21ID` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target `MGMT_value`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
BraTS21ID,MGMT_value
00001,0.5
00013,0.5
00015,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train/** - folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject. **NOTE:** There are some unexpected issues with the following three cases in the training dataset, participants can exclude the cases during training: `[00109, 00123, 00709]`. We have checked and confirmed that the testing dataset is free from such issues.
- **train_labels.csv** - file containing the target `MGMT_value` for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
- **test/** - the test files, which use the same structure as `train/`; your task is to predict the `MGMT_value` for each subject in the test data. **NOTE**: the total size of the rerun test set (Public and Private) is ~5x the size of the Public test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 2. Python version

3.9

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I replace the directory‑scanning ID list with the IDs taken directly from the official sample_submission.csv so the number of rows always matches Kaggle’s expectations. The script now reads the sample submission, keeps the same order, generates dummy predictions (or uses the model if it loads), builds the submission DataFrame with those IDs, and writes a valid submission.csv file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I add the missing imports, avoid loading TensorFlow (since it causes an import error in this environment), and simplify the fallback logic so the script always reads the official sample submission to obtain the test IDs. With these fixes the code runs end‑to‑end and writes a valid `submission.csv` file.'
