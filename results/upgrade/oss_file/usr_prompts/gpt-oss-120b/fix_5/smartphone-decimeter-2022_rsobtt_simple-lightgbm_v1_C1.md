# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Compute smartphones location based on raw location measurements from Android smartphones collected in opensky and light urban roads.

## Metric
Submissions are scored on the mean of the 50th and 95th percentile distance errors. For every `phone` and once per second, the horizontal distance (in meters) is computed between the predicted latitude/longitude and the ground truth latitude/longitude. These distance errors form a distribution from which the 50th and 95th percentile errors are calculated (i.e. the 95th percentile error is the value, in meters, for which 95% of the distance errors are smaller). The 50th and 95th percentile errors are then averaged for each phone. Lastly, the mean of these averaged values is calculated across all phones in the test set.

## Submission Format
For each `phone` and `UnixTimeMillis` in the sample submission, you must predict the latitude and longitude. The sample submission typically requires a prediction once per second but may include larger gaps if there were too few valid GNSS signals. The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:

```

During the conversion, the following treatments are taken to comply with the RINEX format. Essentially, this file contains a subset of information in the _GnssLog.txt.

1. The epoch time (in GPS time scale as per RINEX standard) is computed from [TimeNanos - (FullBiasNanos + BiasNanos)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssClock#getFullBiasNanos()), and then floored to the 100-nanosecond level to meet the precision requirement of the RINEX epoch time. The sub-100-nanosecond part has been wiped out by subtracting the raw pseudorange by the distance equivalent, and by subtracting the carrier phase range by the product of pseudorange rate and the sub-100-nanosecond part.
2. An epoch of measurements will not be converted to RINEX, if any of the following conditions occurs: a) the BiasUncertaintyNanos is larger or equal than 1E6, b) GnssClock values are invalid, e.g. FullBiasNanos is not a meaningful number.
3. Pseudorange value will not be converted if any of the following conditions occurs:

- [STATE_CODE_LOCK](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#STATE_CODE_LOCK) (for non-GAL E1) or [STATE_GAL_E1BC_CODE_LOCK](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#STATE_GAL_E1BC_CODE_LOCK) (for GAL E1) is not set,

- [STATE_GLO_TOD_DECODED](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#STATE_GLO_TOD_DECODED) and [STATE_GLO_TOD_KNOWN](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#STATE_GLO_TOD_KNOWN) are not set for GLO signals,
- CN0 is less than 20 dB-Hz,

1. ReceivedSvTimeUncertaintyNanos is larger than 500 nanoseconds, Carrier frequency is out of nominal range of each band. Loss of lock indicator (LLI) is set to 1 if [ADR_STATE_CYCLE_SLIP](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#ADR_STATE_CYCLE_SLIP) is set, or 2 if [ADR_STATE_HALF_CYCLE_REPORTED](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#ADR_STATE_HALF_CYCLE_REPORTED) is set and [ADR_STATE_HALF_CYCLE_RESOLVED](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#ADR_STATE_HALF_CYCLE_RESOLVED) is not set, or blank if [ADR_STATE_VALID](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#ADR_STATE_VALID) is not set or [ADR_STATE_RESET](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#ADR_STATE_RESET) is set, or 0 otherwise.
