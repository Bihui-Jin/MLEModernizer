# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 7. Whether higher score is better

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I make three safe adjustments: (1) choose CPU when CUDA isn’t available, (2) load the model weights only if the file exists (otherwise continue with the randomly‑initialized model), and (3) keep the rest of the pipeline unchanged so a non‑empty `submission.csv` is written correctly.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00627) has done: 'I adjust the inference to use the classifier logits (via soft‑max and arg‑max) instead of rounding the regression output, wrap the prediction loop in a `torch.no_grad()` block, and load ImageNet‑pretrained EfficientNet‑B4 weights into the backbone when custom weights are missing. These small changes keep the original model architecture intact while providing more meaningful predictions, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.01176) has done: 'The fix makes the ImageNet‑pretrained backbone load with `strict=False` so the custom GeM pooling layer’s missing key is ignored, preventing the runtime error and allowing the model to use pretrained features, which should raise the quadratic weighted kappa toward the target score while keeping the original architecture unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01692) has done: 'I make two minimal, targeted changes: (1) load the full checkpoint with `strict=False` so any matching classifier weights are applied even if the custom GeM layer keys differ, and (2) switch the inference to use the trained regression head (scaled sigmoid output) transformed to discrete classes via the existing `regress2class` function, which aligns better with the quadratic weighted kappa metric. These tweaks keep the original architecture intact while improving prediction quality and moving the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.00407) has done: 'I replace the regression‑based prediction with the model’s classifier logits (argmax) because the classifier head is explicitly trained for the 5‑class problem and usually yields a much higher quadratic weighted kappa than the regression‑to‑class conversion. This small change keeps the overall architecture unchanged, only alters the inference step, and is expected to move the score far closer to the target.'
