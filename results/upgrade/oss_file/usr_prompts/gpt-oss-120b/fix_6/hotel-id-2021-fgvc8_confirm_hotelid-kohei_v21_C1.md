# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Identify hotels from images.

## Metric
Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5)

## Submission Format
For each image in the test set, you must predict a space-delimited list of hotel IDs that could match that image. The first ID should be the most relevant one and the last the least relevant one. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image,hotel_id
99e91ad5f2870678.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
b5cc62ab665591a9.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
d5664a972d5a644b.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
```

## Dataset
**train.csv** - The training set metadata.

- `image` - The image ID.

- `chain` - An ID code for the hotel chain. A `chain` of zero (0) indicates that the hotel is either not part of a chain or the chain is not known. This field is not available for the test set. The number of hotels per chain varies widely.

- `hotel_id` - The hotel ID. The target class.

- `timestamp` - When the image was taken. Provided for the training set only.

**sample_submission.csv** - A sample submission file in the correct format.

- `image` The image ID

- `hotel_id` The hotel ID. The target class.

**train_images** - The training set contains 97000+ images from around 7700 hotels from across the globe. All of the images for each hotel chain are in a dedicated subfolder for that chain.

**test_images** - The test set images. This competition has a hidden test set: only three images are provided here as samples while the remaining 13,000 images will be available to your notebook once it is submitted.

# 2. Python version

3.9

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.

# 4. Data file paths

# 5. Target score

# 6. Current score

0.00153

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.00209) has done: 'I replace the fragile package‑install approach with a self‑contained baseline that reads the provided CSV files, picks the five most frequent hotel IDs from the training data, and writes those as the prediction for every test image. This guarantees a valid `submission.csv` in the required format, allowing the notebook to finish and produce a score (even if modest), moving us from “no submission” toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00153) has done: 'The updates keep the exact algorithm while dramatically cutting image‑processing overhead.  
- Image means are now obtained with Pillow’s fast `ImageStat.Stat` instead of converting each image to a NumPy array, eliminating large temporary buffers.  
- Thread pools are given a larger worker count (`os.cpu_count()*5`) to better saturate I/O without changing any logic.  
- Minor clean‑ups (pre‑computed list conversion, explicit `float32` casting) keep the numerical results identical.'
