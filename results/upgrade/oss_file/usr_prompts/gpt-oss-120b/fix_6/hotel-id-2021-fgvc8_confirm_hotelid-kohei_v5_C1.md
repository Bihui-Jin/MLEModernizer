# Goal

Make the code finish within a 600-second timeout. The last attempt timed out after 10 minutes. Optimize for speed WITHOUT harming result accuracy and WITHOUT changing the core logic.

# Requirements

- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (timeout fix); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Keep file paths unchanged.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Identify hotels from images.

## Metric
Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5)

## Submission Format
For each image in the test set, you must predict a space-delimited list of hotel IDs that could match that image. The first ID should be the most relevant one and the last the least relevant one. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image,hotel_id
99e91ad5f2870678.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
b5cc62ab665591a9.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
d5664a972d5a644b.jpg,36363 53586 18807 64314 60181
```

## Dataset
**train.csv** - The training set metadata.

- `image` - The image ID.

- `chain` - An ID code for the hotel chain. A `chain` of zero (0) indicates that the hotel is either not part of a chain or the chain is not known. This field is not available for the test set. The number of hotels per chain varies widely.

- `hotel_id` - The hotel ID. The target class.

- `timestamp` - When the image was taken. Provided for the training set only.

**sample_submission.csv** - A sample submission file in the correct format.

- `image` The image ID

- `hotel_id` The hotel ID. The target class.

**train_images** - The training set contains 97000+ images from around 7700 hotels from across the globe. All of the images for each hotel chain are in a dedicated subfolder for that chain.

**test_images** - The test set images. This competition has a hidden test set: only three images are provided here as samples while the remaining 13,000 images will be available to your notebook once it is submitted.

# 2. Python version

# 3. Installed packages

No external packages required in the script and installed.
