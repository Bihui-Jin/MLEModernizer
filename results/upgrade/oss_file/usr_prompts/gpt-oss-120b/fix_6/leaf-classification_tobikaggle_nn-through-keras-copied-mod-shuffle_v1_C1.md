# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Use binary leaf images and extracted features to identify the species of plant.

## Metric
Multi-class log loss. 

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission Format
You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of leaf specimens which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. 

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. 

For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

### File descriptions
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **images/** - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields
- **id** - an anonymous id unique to an image
- **margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- **shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- **texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 3.17324) has done: 'I replace the deprecated `keras` imports with the compatible `tensorflow.keras` modules to stop the protobuf import error, and I fix the submission assembly by not using the test IDs as the DataFrame index (which caused mis‑alignment when concatenating). This ensures the script runs end‑to‑end and writes a correctly‑shaped CSV file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.1444) has done: 'The fixes add robust path handling, ensure the predicted class columns are ordered exactly like the label encoder (preventing mismatched probabilities), switch the second hidden layer to a ReLU activation, and train a bit longer (100 epochs) to improve accuracy while keeping the original model structure. These changes resolve the import error, guarantee a correctly‑shaped submission CSV, and should move the log‑loss dramatically closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.11006) has done: 'I replace the failing TensorFlow‑Keras imports with the compatible tf_keras package to eliminate the protobuf error, and I modestly increase model capacity and training epochs (while keeping the same three‑layer structure) to improve the log‑loss toward the target. These changes fix the runtime crash and should raise the score without altering the overall approach.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01411) has done: 'Implemented modest model enhancements to boost validation performance while preserving the original three‑layer structure: increased hidden‑layer sizes, added BatchNormalization and Dropout for better regularization, and extended training epochs to 300. Adjusted imports accordingly and kept all data handling and submission logic unchanged, ensuring a correctly‑shaped CSV is written. These targeted tweaks aim to close the gap toward the target log‑loss without altering the core workflow.'
