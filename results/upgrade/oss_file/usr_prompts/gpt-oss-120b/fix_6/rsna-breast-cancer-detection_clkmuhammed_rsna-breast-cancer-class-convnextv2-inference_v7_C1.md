# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect breast cancer in mammograms.

## Metric
[Probabilistic F1 score](https://aclanthology.org/2020.eval4nlp-1.9.pdf) (pF1). This extension of the traditional F score accepts probabilities instead of binary classifications. 

With pX as the probabilistic version of X:

$$
pF_1 = 2 \frac{pPrecision \cdot pRecall}{pPrecision + pRecall}
$$

where:

$$
pPrecision = \frac{pTP}{pTP + pFP}
$$

$$
pRecall = \frac{pTP}{TP + FN}
$$

## Submission Format
For each `prediction_id`, you should predict the likelihood of cancer in the corresponding `cancer` column. The submission file should have the following format:

```
prediction_id,cancer
0-L,0
0-R,0.5
0-R,0.5
1-L,1
...
# Dataset

**[train/test]_images/[patient_id]/[image_id].dcm** The mammograms, in dicom format. You can expect roughly 8,000 patients in the hidden test set. There are usually but not always 4 images per patient. Note that many of the images use the jpeg 2000 format which may you may need special libraries to load.

**sample_submission.csv** A valid sample submission.

**[train/test].csv** Metadata for each patient and image. Only the first few rows of the test set are available for download.

- `site_id` - ID code for the source hospital.
- `patient_id` - ID code for the patient.
- `image_id` - ID code for the image.
- `laterality` - Whether the image is of the left or right breast.
- `view` - The orientation of the image. The default for a screening exam is to capture two views per breast.
- `age` - The patient's age in years.
- `implant` - Whether or not the patient had breast implants. Site 1 only provides breast implant information at the patient level, not at the breast level.
- `density` - A rating for how dense the breast tissue is, with A being the least dense and D being the most dense. Extremely dense tissue can make diagnosis more difficult. Only provided for train.
- `machine_id` - An ID code for the imaging device.
- `cancer` - Whether or not the breast was positive for malignant cancer. The target value. Only provided for train.
- `biopsy` - Whether or not a follow-up biopsy was performed on the breast. Only provided for train.
- `invasive` - If the breast is positive for cancer, whether or not the cancer proved to be invasive. Only provided for train.
- `BIRADS` - 0 if the breast required follow-up, 1 if the breast was rated as negative for cancer, and 2 if the breast was rated as normal. Only provided for train.
- `prediction_id` - The ID for the matching submission row. Multiple images will share the same prediction ID. Test only.
- `difficult_negative_case` - True if the case was unusually difficult. Only provided for train.
