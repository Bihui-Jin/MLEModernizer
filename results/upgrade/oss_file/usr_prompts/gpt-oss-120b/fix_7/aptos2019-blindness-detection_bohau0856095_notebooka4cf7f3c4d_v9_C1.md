# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

-0.01739

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved -0.02971) has done: 'The fix updates the model so its classifier and regressor match the EfficientNet‑B4 backbone output size (using `backbone.num_features`), and loads saved weights safely as a state dict if they exist. This resolves the tensor shape error during inference, allowing the script to run end‑to‑end and generate a proper `submission.csv` file.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.18533) has done: 'I keep the model architecture unchanged and only modify the inference post‑processing. Instead of taking the arg‑max of the classifier logits, I compute the probability‑weighted expected class and also use the regression head; the two predictions are averaged and rounded to the nearest integer (clipped to 0‑4). This simple calibration often yields a higher quadratic weighted kappa while preserving the original pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.02985) has done: 'I adjust the weight‑loading path to a location that actually exists in the Kaggle environment and fall back gracefully if the file is missing, ensuring the model always has at least the ImageNet‑pretrained backbone. Then I simplify the post‑processing to use the classifier’s arg‑max prediction (which is generally more reliable than the regression head for this task). These minimal changes keep the core architecture untouched while providing a much more sensible prediction, moving the quadratic weighted kappa far toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.06194) has done: 'I improve the inference by combining the classifier’s probability‑weighted expected class with the regression head’s continuous output, then round and clip to the valid label range. This simple calibration usually raises the quadratic weighted kappa while keeping the core model unchanged. The change is confined to the prediction loop in cell 2.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.01739) has done: 'I replace the averaging of the classifier’s expected class with the regression output by a simpler, more reliable post‑processing: use the classifier’s arg‑max prediction (the most probable class) and keep the clipping to the valid label range. This small change aligns the prediction with the model’s primary classification head, which historically raises the quadratic weighted kappa from a negative value toward a modest positive score, moving the result closer to the target without altering the core architecture or training logic.'
