# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Use binary leaf images and extracted features to identify the species of plant.

## Metric
Multi-class log loss. 

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission Format
You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of leaf specimens which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. 

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. 

For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

### File descriptions
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **images/** - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields
- **id** - an anonymous id unique to an image
- **margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- **shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- **texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64** - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.12577) has done: 'I replace the TensorFlow/Keras parts that cause the import error with a scikit‑learn LogisticRegression model, keeping the preprocessing and submission steps unchanged. This fixes the `MessageFactory` AttributeError, ensures the script runs end‑to‑end, and produces a correctly‑formatted CSV of class‑probabilities.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05824) has done: 'The changes fix the validation split error by removing the impossible stratification (the number of classes exceeds the validation size) and improve the model’s fit by reducing regularization (setting a large C value). Additionally, predicted probabilities are clipped to the allowed range before writing the submission file. This enables the script to run end‑to‑end and should bring the log‑loss closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.05824) has done: 'I replace the validation split that caused a class‑mismatch error with a straightforward training‑log‑loss computation using the already‑trained full model. This removes the `ValueError`, keeps the same preprocessing and prediction pipeline, and leaves the final submission generation unchanged, moving the solution back to a runnable state while preserving the core logic.'
