# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given simulated manufacturing control data, predict whether the machine is in state `0` or state `1`.

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `target` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,target
900000,0.65
900001,0.97
900002,0.02
etc.
```

## Dataset
- **train.csv** - the training data, which includes normalized continuous data and categorical data
- **test.csv** - the test set; your task is to predict binary `target` variable which represents the state of a manufacturing process
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

# 5. Target score

0.9971247973944528

# 6. Current score

0.83803

# 7. Whether higher score is better

Higher is better.

# 8. Previous improvement plan

- What this solution (achieved 0.83803) has done: 'I fix the data‑reading step so that object columns are left as strings (preventing the float conversion error) and then factorize them after concatenation. With the dataframe loaded correctly, the subsequent variables (`X_all`, `test_pred`, etc.) are defined, allowing the model to train and a proper CSV submission to be written.'
