# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Create a classifier to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Metric
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.

Images have five possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  Each image is characterized by a tuple *(e*,*e)*, which corresponds to its scores by *Rater A* (human) and *Rater B* (predicted).  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix *O* is constructed, such that *O* corresponds to the number of images that received a rating *i* by *A* and a rating *j* by *B*. An *N-by-N* matrix of weights, *w*, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

An *N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected ratings, *E*, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that *E* and *O* have the same sum.

## Submission Format
```
id_code,diagnosis
0005cfc8afb6,0
003f0afdcd15,0
etc.
```

## Dataset
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using [fundus photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography) under a variety of imaging conditions.

Labels are on a scale of 0 to 4:

> 0 - No DR
> 1 - Mild
> 2 - Moderate
> 3 - Severe
> 4 - Proliferative DR

Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

- **train.csv** - the training labels
- **test.csv** - the test set (you must predict the `diagnosis` value for these variables)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **train.zip** - the training set images
- **test.zip** - the public test set images

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.03826) has done: 'I fix the runtime errors by making the script CPU‑compatible, handling the missing weight file gracefully (fallback to pretrained EfficientNet weights), and ensuring the submission CSV is written correctly. These changes keep the original model architecture and processing logic while allowing the pipeline to run end‑to‑end and produce a non‑empty submission file.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.00162) has done: 'Implemented a minimal inference adjustment: switched from regression‑based class conversion to using the model’s classifier logits (`c_out`) with `argmax`. This aligns predictions with the network’s intended multi‑class output, which is expected to raise the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score toward the target while preserving all other architecture and training logic unchanged. The rest of the pipeline remains identical.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01333) has done: 'We keep the model architecture unchanged but switch inference from the untrained classifier logits to the (still untrained) regression output, rounding it to the nearest integer severity label. This often yields a more balanced class distribution than a random arg‑max, moving the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score upward toward the target while preserving the original pipeline.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.01824) has done: 'I keep the model architecture unchanged but fix two inference issues that hurt the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score: (1) the regression head was scaled by 4.5, which pushes predictions beyond the 0‑4 range; I correct this to 4.0 and clamp after rounding. (2) I now combine the regression‑based class with the ordinal‑based class (derived from the model’s ordinal output) by averaging the two predictions, which gives a more balanced output than using a single noisy head. These minimal changes keep the core logic intact while producing a more realistic class distribution and therefore moving the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -0.04109) has done: 'I replace the current inference logic with a simpler, classifier‑only prediction (argmax of the model’s `c_out` logits). This keeps the architecture untouched, removes the noisy regression/ordinal averaging that was generating essentially random classes, and is expected to raise the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score significantly toward the target while still producing a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.06275) has done: 'I keep the model architecture unchanged and only adjust the inference step.  
Instead of using the raw classifier logits (which are essentially random without fine‑tuned weights), I combine the classifier’s arg‑max prediction with the regression head’s threshold‑based class conversion. The two predictions are averaged and rounded, then clamped to the valid range 0‑4. This small change preserves the original pipeline while yielding a more balanced and sensible class distribution, which should move the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.0) has done: 'I load the training labels to compute the most common diagnosis and replace the random‑looking model inference with this majority‑class prediction (still keeping the model definition/loading unchanged). Using the majority class yields a much more sensible baseline than the previous argmax‑and‑regression averaging, so the Quadratic Weighted Kappa move closer to the target score.'
