# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 1.39779) has done: 'I set the script to skip any model training or loading and instead generate a baseline submission using the average class probabilities derived from the training metadata. This removes the parquet‑reading that triggers the protobuf error and guarantees a correctly formatted `submission.csv` with probabilities that sum to 1.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.64506) has done: 'I replace the single‑cell script with a minimal version that still skips any model training but improves the baseline by using per‑patient average vote distributions when the patient appears in the training set; otherwise it falls back to the overall average. This adds only a lightweight grouping step, keeps the same file handling, and should lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.64506) has done: 'I keep the original workflow but add a per‑eeg‑id averaging step, which is more specific than the patient‑level averages already used. Test rows that share an `eeg_id` with the training set receive that exact averaged distribution, while the remaining rows fall back to patient averages (if available) and finally to the overall average. This extra granularity should move the KL‑divergence lower, bringing the score closer to the target without altering the core logic or introducing new models.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.64506) has done: 'I adjust the fallback logic so that any test rows whose `eeg_id` was not found get their predictions filled from the patient‑level averages (when available) instead of only when the whole row still equals the overall average. This gives more specific predictions for many rows and should lower the KL‑divergence, moving the score closer to the target while keeping the overall averaging strategy unchanged.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.7289) has done: 'I add a small smoothing step when using the per‑eeg‑id and per‑patient averages so that predictions are blended with the overall class distribution based on how many training rows support each average. This reduces overly confident probabilities, which typically lowers the KL‑divergence and moves the score toward the target while keeping the original averaging‑only logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.71423) has done: 'I reduce the smoothing factor from 10.0 to 2.0 so the per‑eeg and per‑patient averages have a stronger influence while still keeping a modest blend with the overall distribution. This small change stays within the original averaging‑only logic, preserves the normalization step, and is expected to lower the KL‑divergence, moving the score closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.73577) has done: 'I lower the smoothing factor from 2.0 to 0.5 so the per‑eeg and per‑patient averages dominate the prediction (reducing reliance on the overall prior). This simple change stays within the original averaging‑only logic, keeps the normalization step, and is expected to bring the KL‑divergence closer to the target score.'
