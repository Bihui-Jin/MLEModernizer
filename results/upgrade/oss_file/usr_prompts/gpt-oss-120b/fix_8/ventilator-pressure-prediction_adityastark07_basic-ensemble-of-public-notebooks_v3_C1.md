# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given time series of breaths, predict the airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the breath, given the time series of control inputs.

The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.

## Metric
Mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath. The expiratory phase is not scored.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a value for the `pressure` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,pressure
1,20
2,23
3,24
etc.
```

## Dataset
The ventilator data used in this competition was produced using a modified [open-source ventilator](https://pvp.readthedocs.io/) connected to an [artificial bellows test lung](https://www.ingmarmed.com/product/quicklung/) via a respiratory circuit. The diagram below illustrates the setup, with the two control inputs highlighted in green and the state variable (airway pressure) to predict in blue. The first control input is a continuous variable from 0 to 100 representing the percentage the inspiratory solenoid valve is open to let air into the lung (i.e., 0 is completely closed and no air is let in and 100 is completely open). The second control input is a binary variable representing whether the exploratory valve is open (1) or closed (0) to let air out.

![Ventilator diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deluca-lung/main/assets/2020-10-02%20Ventilator%20diagram.svg)

Each time series represents an approximately 3-second breath. The files are organized such that each row is a time step in a breath and gives the two control signals, the resulting airway pressure, and relevant attributes of the lung, described below.

### Files
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Columns
- `id` - globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file
- `breath_id` - globally-unique time step for breaths
- `R` - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change `R` by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher `R` being harder to blow.
- `C` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change `C` by changing the thickness of the balloon’s latex, with higher `C` having thinner latex and easier to blow.
- `time_step` - the actual time stamp.
- `u_in` - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.
- `u_out` - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.
- `pressure` - the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O.

- What this solution (achieved 6.73433) has done: 'I replace the failing blending code with a simple, self‑contained baseline that loads the provided train and test CSV files, computes the mean pressure for each combination of resistance (R), compliance (C) and rounded inspiratory flow (u_in), and uses these averages as predictions for the test set. Missing groups fall back to the global mean. This resolves the file‑not‑found errors, ensures a valid `submission.csv` with the required columns, and provides a reasonable MAE baseline that moves the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 3.90908) has done: 'I add a finer‑grained grouping feature that captures the time‑step dynamics (by binning `time_step` to centiseconds) and also include the binary valve `u_out`.  This richer grouping provides much more specific mean pressure values, which reduces the MAE toward the target while keeping the overall simple mean‑lookup approach.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.71851) has done: 'I protect the linear‑fit computation so that groups without enough variation in `u_in` no longer raise an SVD error, and I make sure the `submission` DataFrame is always created before it is written. This fixes the runtime exceptions while preserving the original mean‑lookup‑plus‑linear‑adjustment logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.02412) has done: 'I replace the simple group‑lookup logic with a lightweight RandomForest model that uses the original numeric features (R, C, u_in, u_out, time_bin, time_step). This keeps the overall workflow the same (load CSVs, predict, write submission) but adds a more expressive predictor, which should substantially lower the MAE and move the score toward the target. The changes are limited to model training/prediction and do not alter file handling or submission format.'
