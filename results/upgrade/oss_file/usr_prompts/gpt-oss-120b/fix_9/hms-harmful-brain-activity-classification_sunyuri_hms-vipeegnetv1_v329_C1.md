# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Detect and classify harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or "other".

## Metric
Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission Format
For each `eeg_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the `vote` columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote\
0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167\
etc.
```

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

## Dataset
**train.csv** Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. `train.csv` provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- `eeg_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `eeg_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `eeg_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- `spectrogram_id` - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- `spectrogram_sub_id` - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- `spectogram_label_offset_seconds` - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- `label_id` - An ID for this set of labels.
- `patient_id` - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- `expert_consensus` - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: `lpd`: lateralized periodic discharges, `gpd`: generalized periodic discharges, `lrd`: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and `grda`: generalized rhythmic delta activity . A detailed explanations of these patterns is [available here.](https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/ACNSStandardizedCriticalCareEEGTerminology_rev2021.pdf)

**test.csv** Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- `eeg_id`
- `spectrogram_id`
- `patient_id`

**sample_submission.csv**

- `eeg_id`
- `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote` - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

**train_eegs/** EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are [the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_%28EEG%29), with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

**test_eegs/** Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

**test_spectrograms/** Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

**example_figures/** Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

- What this solution (achieved 1.40995) has done: 'I set NEEDTRAIN to False so the script skips all TensorFlow model building and training, and replace the inference section with a simple baseline that outputs uniform probabilities for each class (which always sum to 1). This eliminates the protobuf MessageFactory error caused by the TensorFlow import and guarantees that a valid submission.csv file is produced.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.64506) has done: 'The fix replaces the naïve uniform baseline with a data‑driven prediction: it computes class‑probability distributions from the training votes, derives overall and per‑patient average distributions, and uses the patient‑specific distribution when the test row’s patient appears in the training set. This leverages existing training information without adding complex models, keeps the original workflow, and ensures predictions sum to 1, which should lower the KL divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.64506) has done: 'I suppress the problematic TensorFlow import by hard‑coding `tf_available = False` and keep the rest of the setup unchanged.  
In the prediction cell I add a per‑eeg‑id average distribution (the most specific information) and fall back to the per‑patient average and finally the overall mean. Missing matches are filled with the overall mean, and all rows are renormalised to sum to 1. This small change uses existing training votes more effectively, removes the import error, and should lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score while preserving the original workflow.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.7289) has done: 'I keep the overall workflow but replace the simple patient/eeg‑specific averages with a shrinkage blend that falls back toward the overall class distribution when a patient or eeg has few training rows. This reduces noise from small groups, keeps predictions summing to 1, and should lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 1.68479) has done: 'I fixed the dimensional‑indexing error by converting the pandas Series `patient_totals` and `eeg_totals` to NumPy arrays before adding a new axis. Then I replaced the shrinkage‑by‑beta logic with a direct empirical estimate (no artificial smoothing) – using each patient’s or EEG’s observed vote distribution when available, otherwise falling back to the overall mean. This keeps the original workflow, guarantees predictions sum to 1, and should lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.77466) has done: 'I add Laplace smoothing and a simple shrinkage blend for the per‑patient and per‑eeg distributions. Each group’s distribution is combined with the overall mean using a weight = n/(n+α) (α = 10). This reduces noise from small groups, keeps predictions valid (sum = 1), and is expected to lower the KL‑divergence toward the target score without altering the overall workflow.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.79979) has done: 'Implemented a tighter, data‑driven probability estimate by removing the Laplace +1 smoothing and using a much smaller shrinkage strength (α = 1). This lets per‑patient and per‑eeg empirical vote distributions dominate the prediction, which is expected to lower the KL‑divergence and move the score toward the target while preserving the original workflow and valid CSV output.'
