# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (`FVC`), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

## Metric
A modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. 

For each true FVC measurement, you will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation 𝜎𝜎). The metric is computed as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{\text {clipped }}=\max (\sigma, 70), \\
\Delta=\min \left(\left|F V C_{\text {true }}-F V C_{\text {predicted }}\right|, 1000\right), \\
\text { metric }=-\frac{\sqrt{2} \Delta}{\sigma_{\text {clipped }}}-\ln \left(\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text {clipped }}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set `Patient_Week`s (three per patient). 

Metric values will be negative and higher is better.

## Submission Format
For each `Patient_Week`, you must predict the `FVC` and a confidence. You are asked to predict every patient's `FVC` measurement for every possible week. Those weeks which are not in the final three visits are ignored in scoring.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Patient_Week,FVC,Confidence
ID00002637202176704235138_1,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_2,2000,100
ID00002637202176704235138_3,2000,100
etc.

```

## Dataset
In the dataset, you are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time `Week = 0` and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their `FVC` is measured.

- In the training set, you are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.
- In the test set, you are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. **You are asked to predict the final three `FVC` measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.**

- **train.csv** - the training set, contains full history of clinical information
- **test.csv** - the test set, contains only the baseline measurement
- **train/** - contains the training patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **test/** - contains the test patients' baseline CT scan in DICOM format
- **sample_submission.csv** - demonstrates the submission format

**train.csv and test.csv**

- `Patient`a unique Id for each patient (also the name of the patient's DICOM folder)
- `Weeks`the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)
- `FVC` - the recorded lung capacity in ml
- `Percent`a computed field which approximates the patient's FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics
- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `SmokingStatus`

**sample submission.csv**

- `Patient_Week` - a unique Id formed by concatenating the `Patient` and `Weeks` columns (i.e. ABC_22 is a prediction for patient ABC at week 22)
- `FVC` - the predicted FVC in ml
- `Confidence` - a confidence value of your prediction (also has units of ml)

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved nan) has done: 'I fix the pandas `.append` removal by using `pd.concat`, and replace the missing model loading with a simple placeholder that copies the test features and creates the required `FVC` and `Confidence` columns. This keeps the original workflow intact while ensuring the script runs end‑to‑end and writes a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.36034) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged and only fix the part that leaves many `FVC` and `Confidence` values as `NaN`.  
First I compute a global average weekly FVC change from the training set, then I use this slope to fill every missing prediction (baseline weeks are still set to the original `base_FVC` and a confidence of 70).  
Finally I clamp all confidence values to the mandatory minimum 70 and write the `submission.csv`. This produces a complete, valid submission and moves the score toward the target without altering the core model logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.36034) has done: 'I replace the simple global‑average weekly change with a per‑patient average change when possible, falling back to the global average otherwise. This keeps the original pipeline intact but gives each patient a more tailored slope, which should raise the predicted FVC values and move the metric closer to the target score. The confidence handling remains unchanged to respect the required minimum of 70.'
- What this solution (achieved nan) has done: 'I replace the simple average‑slope filling with a lightweight linear‑regression that uses the baseline clinical features (baseline FVC, age, percent‑based healthy FVC, sex and smoking flags) to predict the per‑week FVC change. This keeps the overall pipeline unchanged, only augments the missing‑value step, and is expected to raise the predicted FVC values modestly, moving the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target while preserving the required confidence‑minimum logic.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.07698) has done: 'I add one‑hot encoding of the categorical columns (`Sex` and `SmokingStatus`) to the training dataframe before building the regression features. This supplies the missing “Male”, “Female”, “Ex‑smoker”, “Never smoked”, and “Currently smokes” columns that caused the KeyError, allowing the linear model to train and the subsequent prediction‑filling logic to run, producing a valid `submission.csv` and moving the score toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.07698) has done: 'I adjust the filling logic to add a small average‑residual correction derived from the training regression, and I raise the minimum confidence from 70 to 100 so the metric’s penalty from low sigma is reduced. These minimal, targeted changes keep the original pipeline intact while nudging the score upward toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -10.07698) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged but improve the missing‑value filling: use the per‑patient average weekly change when it is available (instead of always relying on the global linear regression) and keep the confidence at the required minimum 70 instead of the higher 100. These small adjustments should raise the predicted FVC values toward the true values and move the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score upward toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved -9.0354) has done: 'I adjust the missing‑value filling logic to use a more stable global weekly change when a patient‑specific slope is unavailable, raise the minimum confidence from 70 to 100 so the penalty from large errors is softened, and remove the residual bias correction that was pulling predictions away from the true values. These small, targeted changes keep the overall pipeline unchanged while nudging the FVC predictions upward and raising confidence, which should increase the Laplace‑Log‑Likelihood score toward the target.'
