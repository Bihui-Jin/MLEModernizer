# Goal

I want you to improve my Kaggle competition solution to increase the score toward a target. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Predict whether a lesion is malignant (0 denotes **benign**, and 1 indicates **malignant**).

## Metric
Area under the ROC curve.

## Submission Format
For each `image_name` in the test set, you must predict the probability (`target`) that the sample is **malignant**. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_name,target
ISIC_0052060,0.7
ISIC_0052349,0.9
ISIC_0058510,0.8
ISIC_0073313,0.5
ISIC_0073502,0.5
etc.
```

## Dataset 
The images are provided in DICOM format.

Images are also provided in JPEG and TFRecord format (in the `jpeg` and `tfrecords` directories, respectively). Images in TFRecord format have been resized to a uniform 1024x1024.

Metadata is also provided outside of the DICOM format, in CSV files. See the `Columns` section for a description.

### Files
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Columns
- `image_name` - unique identifier, points to filename of related DICOM image
- `patient_id` - unique patient identifier
- `sex` - the sex of the patient (when unknown, will be blank)
- `age_approx` - approximate patient age at time of imaging
- `anatom_site_general_challenge` - location of imaged site
- `diagnosis` - detailed diagnosis information (train only)
- `benign_malignant` - indicator of malignancy of imaged lesion
- `target` - binarized version of the target variable

# 8. Previous improvement plans

- What this solution (achieved 0.58842) has done: 'I adjust the preprocessing to handle columns that are absent in the test set and drop non‑numeric identifier columns before encoding. This prevents KeyErrors and removes string columns that cause the model to fail. I also ensure the training and test feature matrices have identical column ordering. These fixes let the pipeline run end‑to‑end and produce a valid `submission.csv`.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline unchanged and only adjust the GradientBoostingClassifier hyper‑parameters (more trees, lower learning rate, a modest max depth and a subsample fraction, plus class‑weight balancing). These tweaks are lightweight but commonly raise ROC‑AUC, moving the validation score closer to the target without altering the core logic or feature handling.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I slightly adjust the GradientBoosting hyper‑parameters (increase `max_depth` to 4, raise `learning_rate` to 0.1 and reduce `n_estimators` to 500) and **remove the custom `sample_weight`** that was unintentionally down‑weighting the training signal. These minimal tweaks keep the same model class and overall pipeline while usually delivering a noticeably higher ROC‑AUC, moving the validation score closer to the target without altering any core logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.49996) has done: 'I keep the overall pipeline and feature handling unchanged, but adjust the GradientBoostingClassifier hyper‑parameters to a stronger configuration (more trees, lower learning rate, slightly deeper trees, higher subsample, and class‑weight balancing). These modest changes are expected to raise the validation ROC‑AUC and move the score closer to the target without altering the core logic.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I remove the custom inverse‑frequency sample weighting (which was down‑weighting the signal) and instead train the GradientBoostingClassifier with a more standard, stronger configuration (moderate number of trees, higher learning rate, shallower trees and a modest subsample). This keeps the same model class and preprocessing while addressing the main cause of the near‑random AUC, moving the validation score upward toward the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 0.5) has done: 'I updated the preprocessing function to always create `_code` columns for every categorical feature seen during training, even if that feature is absent in the test set, and added a re‑index step so the test matrix has exactly the same column order as the training matrix. This resolves the “feature names should match” error and ensures a valid `submission.csv` is written.'
