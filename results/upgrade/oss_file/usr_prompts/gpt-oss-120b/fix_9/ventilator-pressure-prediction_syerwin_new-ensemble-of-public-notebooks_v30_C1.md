# Goal

I want you to fix bugs and increase the score toward a target for a Kaggle competition solution. Here is the information you need.

# Requirements

- Keep changes minimal unless necessary.
- Preserve the core logic, including model architecture, layers, training approach/loops, feature extraction, or loss function. Maintain identical core logic and evaluation semantics; only allow negligible floating-point differences.
- Every change must be directly relevant to the stated issue (big fix and/or evaluation score improvement); avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic edits.
- Do NOT introduce extra approximations, sampling, reduced precision, early stopping, or relaxed convergence criteria.
- Ensure it runs end-to-end and produces a valid submission file.


# 1. Kaggle task description

## Task
Given time series of breaths, predict the airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the breath, given the time series of control inputs.

The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.

## Metric
Mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath. The expiratory phase is not scored.

## Submission Format
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a value for the `pressure` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,pressure
1,20
2,23
3,24
etc.
```

## Dataset
The ventilator data used in this competition was produced using a modified [open-source ventilator](https://pvp.readthedocs.io/) connected to an [artificial bellows test lung](https://www.ingmarmed.com/product/quicklung/) via a respiratory circuit. The diagram below illustrates the setup, with the two control inputs highlighted in green and the state variable (airway pressure) to predict in blue. The first control input is a continuous variable from 0 to 100 representing the percentage the inspiratory solenoid valve is open to let air into the lung (i.e., 0 is completely closed and no air is let in and 100 is completely open). The second control input is a binary variable representing whether the exploratory valve is open (1) or closed (0) to let air out.

![Ventilator diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deluca-lung/main/assets/2020-10-02%20Ventilator%20diagram.svg)

Each time series represents an approximately 3-second breath. The files are organized such that each row is a time step in a breath and gives the two control signals, the resulting airway pressure, and relevant attributes of the lung, described below.

### Files
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Columns
- `id` - globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file
- `breath_id` - globally-unique time step for breaths
- `R` - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change `R` by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher `R` being harder to blow.
- `C` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change `C` by changing the thickness of the balloon’s latex, with higher `C` having thinner latex and easier to blow.
- `time_step` - the actual time stamp.
- `u_in` - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.
- `u_out` - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.
- `pressure` - the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O.

- What this solution (achieved 5.73394) has done: 'I remove the failing external file loads and replace them with a simple, deterministic model built from the provided training data. The new script reads the train and test CSVs, trains a polynomial linear regression (degree 2) on the relevant features, evaluates MAE on a validation split (so you can see the score), then predicts pressures for the test set and writes a correctly‑formatted `submission.csv`. This fixes the FileNotFoundError, ensures a valid submission file, and moves the score toward the target without changing the overall workflow.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.1726) has done: 'I keep the overall workflow but replace the simple polynomial linear model with a tree‑based regressor that can capture the non‑linear relationship between the control signals and pressure. Adding the `breath_id` as an extra feature gives the model information about each breath’s baseline. Using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` (fast on large tables) should sharply lower the MAE, moving the score much closer to the target while preserving the original data handling and submission steps.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.11924) has done: 'The fix removes the invalid `categorical_features` argument (the `breath_id` column has far more than 255 unique values, which HistGradientBoosting cannot treat as categorical) and adds a few simple polynomial features (`u_in_sq`, `time_step_sq`, `u_in_time`) to give the model a bit more expressive power while keeping the original workflow unchanged. This resolves the training error and enables successful prediction and CSV submission generation.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.04514) has done: 'The changes add a few more interaction features (e.g., `u_in_R`, `u_in_C`, `R_C`) that give the tree‑based model extra expressive power, drop the high‑cardinality `breath_id` which can act as noise for HistGradientBoosting, and tighten the boosting parameters (more iterations and a smaller learning rate) to let the model fit the data more accurately. These modest adjustments keep the overall workflow intact while moving the MAE noticeably closer to the target.'
- What this solution (achieved 4.12111) has done: 'I fixed the `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` initialization by removing the unsupported `subsample` argument, which caused the model to fail to create. This allows the training to complete, produces predictions, and writes a correctly‑formatted `submission.csv`. No other logic is changed, preserving the original feature engineering and overall workflow.'
